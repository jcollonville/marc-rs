Showcasing a breadth of theoretical and contextual approaches to the study of Romanticism, John Isbell provides an insightful contemporary overview of the field, paired with wide-ranging comparative reflections on the art and literature that helped shape it. Discussing seminal Romantic texts such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, or Germaine de Staël's Corinne ou l'Italie, Isbell provides a foundation through which to investigate core concepts, such as the continuum of Romance, the Romantic hero, and Romantic literature's characteristic repudiation of its own Romanticism. Unusually for a single-author monograph, the book includes both published and unpublished material covering Romantic creation across Europe and the two Americas. Identifying Romanticism as an international movement, Isbell seeks to emphasise a theme frequently ignored by many academics: the roots of Romanticism, and its variations, as a national art. His arguments are supported by extensive interrogations of the political and historical contexts that moulded the outlooks of the writers and artists central to the period. An Outline of Romanticism in the West underlines the interplay between nationalism, history, and artistic inspiration, and will therefore be of value to students and scholars of literature and history, as well as to general readers with an interest in Romanticism in the West."--Publisher's website. 0aRomanticismzEurope. 0aRomanticismzUnited States.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0302zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0302.jpgzConnect to cover image05690nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000260013602000260016202000250018803500220021304000210023510000310025624501170028726400470040426400110045130000640046233600260052633700330055233700260058533800360061150000440064750600480069153800360073954001650077550000850094050400550102550519730108052015970305360000360465061000440468665000420473065000540477265000500482665000160487665000310489265000320492371000420495571000380499785600570503585600920509299100580652970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         190723t20192019enka    sb    001 0 eng d  a9781783745180q(pdf)  a9781783745197q(epub)  a9781783745203q(mobi)  a9781783747252q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1110486874  aStSaULbengerda1 aRudy, Kathryn M.,eauthor.10aImage, knife, and gluepoth[electronic resource] :bearly assemblage in manuscript and print /cKathryn M.

Image, Knife, and Gluepot painstakingly reconstructs the process by which this manuscript was created and discusses its significance as a text at the forefront of fifteenth-century book production, when the invention of mechanically-produced images led to the creation of new multimedia objects. Rudy then travels to the nineteenth century to examine the phenomenon of manuscript books being pillaged for their prints and drawings: she has diligently tracked down the dismembered parts of this book of hours for the first time. Image, Knife, and Gluepot also documents Rudy's twenty-first-century research process, as she hunts through archives while grappling with the logistics and occasionally the limits of academic research. This is a timely volume, focusing on questions of materiality at the forefront of medieval and literary studies. Beautifully illustrated throughout, its use of original material and its striking interdisciplinary approach, combining book and art history, make it a significant academic achievement. Image, Knife, and Gluepot is a valuable text for any scholar in the fields of medieval studies, the history of early books and publishing, cultural history or material culture. Written in Rudy's inimitable style, it will also be rewarding for any student enrolled in a course on manuscript production, as well as non-specialists interested in the afterlives of manuscripts and prints."--Publisher's website. 10aMeckenem, Israhel van,d -1503.20aCatholic ChurchxPrayers and devotions. 0aBooks of hourszNetherlandsxHistory. 0aIllumination of books and manuscripts, Medieval.  0aManuscripts, MedievalxHistory and criticism. 0aCodicology. 0aBooksxHistoryy1450-1600. 0aMaterial culturexResearch.2 aRoyal Society of Edinburgh,esponsor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0145zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0145.jpgzConnect to cover image03859nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028524501770030626400470048326400110053030000340054133600260057533700260060133800360062750000440066350600480070753800360075554001820079150400550097350503650102852014670139365000540286065000750291465000450298970000350303470000260306970000410309571000380313674000660317485600570324085600920329799100580745970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         190723t20192019enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783747115 (hbk.)  z9781783747108 (pbk.)  a9781783747122q(pdf)  a9781783747139q(epub)  a9781783747146q(mobi)  a9781783747153q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1110486079  aStSaULbengerda00aMake we merry more and lessh[electronic resource] :ban anthology of medieval English popular literature /cselected and introduced by Douglas Gray ; edited by Jane Bliss. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (418 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Uniquely, the book is divided by genre, allowing readers to make connections between texts usually presented individually. This anthology offers a fruitful exploration of the boundary between literary and popular culture, and showcases an impressive breadth of literature, including songs, drama, and ballads. Familiar texts such as the visions of Margery Kempe and the Paston family letters are featured alongside lesser-known works, often oral. This striking diversity extends to the language: the anthology includes Scottish literature and original translations of Latin and French texts. The illuminating introduction offers essential information that will enhance the reader's enjoyment of the chosen texts. Each of the chapters is accompanied by a clear summary explaining the particular delights of the literature selected and the rationale behind the choices made. An invaluable resource to gain an in-depth understanding of the culture of the period, this is essential reading for any student or scholar of medieval English literature, and for anyone interested in folklore or popular material of the time. The book was left unfinished at Gray's death; it is here edited by Jane Bliss."--Publisher's website.  0aFolk literature, EnglishxHistory and criticism.  0aEnglish literatureyMiddle English, 1100-1500xHistory and criticism.  0aLiterature and folklorezGreat Britain. 1 aGray, Douglas,d1930-eeditor.1 aBliss, Jane,eeditor.1 aGray, Douglas,d1930-tSimple forms.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.0 aSimple forms : essays on medieval English popular literature.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0170zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0170.jpgzConnect to cover image03190nam a2200409 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000280030624501090033426400470044326400110049030000610050133600260056233700260058833800360061450000440065050600480069453800360074254001650077850000760094350502700101952012660128965000380255571000380259385600570263185600920268899100581489970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         190801t20192019enka    s     000 0 eng d  z9781783740239 (hbk.)  z9781783740222 (pbk.)  a9781783740246q(pdf)  a9781783740253q(epub)  a9781783740260q(mobi)  a9781783747788q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1111810298  aStSaULbengerda1 aRingmar, Erik,eauthor.10aHistory of international relationsh[electronic resource] :ba non-European perspective /cErik Ringmar. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (218 pages) :b9 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This textbook pioneers a new approach by historicizing the material traditionally taught in International Relations courses, and by explicitly focusing on non-European cases, debates and issues. The volume is divided into three parts. The first part focuses on the international systems that traditionally existed in Europe, East Asia, pre-Columbian Central and South America, Africa and Polynesia. The second part discusses the ways in which these international systems were brought into contact with each other through the agency of Mongols in Central Asia, Arabs in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, Indic and Sinic societies in South East Asia, and the Europeans through their travels and colonial expansion. The concluding section concerns contemporary issues: the processes of decolonization, neo-colonialism and globalization - and their consequences on contemporary society. History of International Relations provides a unique textbook for undergraduate and graduate students of international relations, and anybody interested in international relations theory, history, and contemporary politics."--Publisher's website.  0aInternational relationsxHistory.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0074zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0074.jpgzConnect to cover image04396nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028524501220030626400470042826400110047530000840048633600260057033700260059633800360062250000440065850600480070253800360075054001650078650400530095150509680100452014860197265000290345865000280348765000740351565000530358965100420364270000290368470000260371371000380373985600570377785600920383499100589582970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         190819t20192019enkab   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783747054 (hbk.)  z9781783747047 (pbk.)  a9781783747061q(pdf)  a9781783747078q(epub)  a9781783747085q(mobi)  a9781783747092q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1114968068  aStSaULbengerda04aThe politics of language contact in the Himalayah[electronic resource] /cedited by Selma K.

Promoting a linguistically and historically grounded perspective, The Politics of Language Contact in the Himalaya offers nuanced insights into language and its relation to power in this geopolitically complex region. Edited by respected scholars in the field, the collection comprises five new research contributions by established and early-career researchers who have been significantly engaged in the Himalayan region. Grounded in a commitment to theoretically informed area studies, and covering Tibet (China), Assam (India), and Nepal, each case study is situated within contemporary debates in sociolinguistics, political science, and language policy and planning. Bridging disciplines and transcending nation-states, the volume offers a unique contribution to the study of language contact and its political implications. The Politics of Language Contact in the Himalaya is essential reading for researchers in the fields of language policy and planning, applied linguistics, and language and literary education. The detailed introduction and concluding commentary make the collection accessible to all social scientists concerned with questions of language, and the volume as a whole will be of interest to scholars in anthropology, sociolinguistics, political science and Asian studies."--Publisher's website.  0aTibeto-Burman languages. 0aSino-Tibetan languages. 0aLanguage and languagesxPolitical aspectszHimalaya Mountains Region. 0aLanguage and culturezHimalaya Mountains Region. 0aHimalaya Mountains RegionxLanguages.1 aSonntag, Selma,eeditor.1 aTurin, Mark,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0169zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0169.jpgzConnect to cover image04328nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000300030624501120033626400470044826400110049530000630050633600260056933700260059533800360062150000440065750600480070153800360074954001650078550001160095050509480106652016170201465000470363170000410367871000380371985600570375785600920381499100630495970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         190910t20192019enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783747511 (hbk.)  z9781783747504 (pbk.)  a9781783747528q(pdf)  a9781783747535q(epub)  a9781783747542q(mobi)  a9781783747559q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1135561236  aStSaULbengerda1 aWilson, John W.,eauthor.10aConservation biology in sub-Saharan Africah[electronic resource] /cJohn W.

His diaries, written between 1862 and 1912, lift the veil of anonymity hiding the people, processes and networks involved in the creation of Victorian newspapers. They also tell us about Victorian fatherhood, family life, and the culture of a Victorian town. Diaries of nineteenth-century provincial journalists are extremely rare. Anthony Hewitson went from printer's apprentice to newspaper reporter and eventually editor of his own paper. Every night he jotted down the day's doings, his thoughts and feelings. The diaries are a lively account of the reporter's daily round, covering meetings and court cases, hunting for gossip or attending public executions and variety shows, in and around Preston, Lancashire. Andrew Hobbs's introduction and footnotes provide background and analysis of these valuable documents. This full scholarly edition offers a wealth of new information about reporting, freelancing, sub-editing, newspaper ownership and publishing, and illuminates aspects of Victorian periodicals and culture extending far beyond provincial newspapers. The Diaries of Anthony Hewitson, Provincial Journalist are an indispensable research tool for local and regional historians, as well as social and political historians with an interest in Victorian studies and the media. They are also illuminating for anyone interested in nineteenth-century social and cultural history."--Publisher's website.10aAtticus,d1835 or 1836-1912. 0aJournalistszEnglandzLancashire. 0aPreston (Lancashire, England)vBiography. 0aPreston (Lancashire, England)xSocial life and customs. 0aPreston (Lancashire, England)xSocial conditionsxHistoryy19th century.1 aHobbs, Andrew,eeditor,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0262zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0262.jpgzConnect to cover image03630nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027202200220029802200230032004000210034304300120036410000290037624501470040526400460055226400110059830000580060933600260066733700260069333800360071949000430075550000440079850600480084253800360089054001490092650400530107550506620112852010240179063000660281463000430288071000380292383000380296185600570299985600920305699100640581970896620250522155714.0m     o  d        cr##n#########221007t20222022enka    sb    001 0aeng d  z9781800643994 (Hardback)  z9781800643987 (Paperback)  a9781800644007q(pdf)  a9781800649224q(HTML)  a9781800644038q(XML)  a9781800644014q(epub)  a9781800644021q(azw3)  z2753-8036 (Print)  z2753-8044 (Online)  aStSaULbengerda  ae------1 aLukman, Fadhli,eauthor.14aThe official Indonesian Qur'ān translationh[electronic resource] :bthe history and politics of Al-Qur'an dan Terjemahnya /cFadhli Lukman. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xx, 346 pages) :b3 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe Global Qur'anx2753-8044 ;vvol. 1  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

It investigates how the translation was produced and presented, and how it is read, as well as considering the implications of the state's involvement in such a work. Lukman analyses the politicisation of the Qurʾān commentary through discussion of how the tafsīr mechanism functions in this version, weighing up the translation's dual constraints: the growing political context, on the one hand, and the tafsīr tradition on the other. In doing so, the book pays attention to three key areas: the production phase, the textual material, and the reception of the translation by readers. This book will be of value to scholars with an interest in tafsīr studies, modern and Southeast Asian or Indonesian tafsīr sub-fields, the study of Qurʾān translations, and Indonesian politics and religion more broadly."--Publisher's website.00aQurʼanvTranslations into IndonesianxHistory and criticism.00aQur'anxStudy and teachingzIndonesia.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aGlobal Qur'an ;vv. 1.x2753-804440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0289zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0289.jpgzConnect to cover image03810nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000420030624501070034826400470045526400110050230000620051333600260057533600330060133700260063433800360066050000440069650600480074053800360078854001650082450508310098952013130182060000470313365000210318071000380320185600570323985600920329699100644141970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         190927t20192019enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783747573 (hbk.)  z9781783747566 (pbk.)  a9781783747580q(pdf)  a9781783747597q(epub)  a9781783747603q(mobi)  a9781783747610q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1122450935  aStSaULbengerda1 aLisboa, Maria Manuel,d1963-eauthor.10aEssays on Paula Regoh[electronic resource] :bsmile when you think about hell /cMaria Manuel Lisboa. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (510 pages) :b81 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Focusing primarily on Rego's work since the 1980s, Lisboa explores the complex relationships between violence and nurturing, power and impotence, politics and the family that run through Rego's art. Taking a historicist approach to the evolution of the artist's work, Lisboa embeds the works within Rego's personal history as well as Portugal's (and indeed other nations') stories, and reveals the interrelationship between political significance and the raw emotion that lies at the heart of Rego's uncompromising iconographic style. Fundamental to Lisboa's analysis is an understanding that apparent opposites - male and female, sacred and profane, aggression and submissiveness - often co-exist in Rego's work in a way that is both disturbing and destabilising. This collection of essays brings together both unpublished and previously published work to make a significant contribution to scholarship about Paula Rego. It will also be of interest to scholars and students of contemporary painting, Portuguese and British feminist art, and the political and ideological aspects of the visual arts."--Publisher's website. 10aRego, PaulaxCriticism and interpretation. 0aFeminism in art.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0178zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0178.jpgzConnect to cover image04499nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024702200230027202200230029503500230031804000210034124502070036226400460056926400110061530000630062633600260068933700260071533800360074149000430077750000440082050600480086453800360091254001650094850000650111350505750117852015870175365000310334065000380337165000250340970000330343470000310346770000380349870000330353670000340356970000290360370000340363270000360366671000380370283000440374085600570378485600920384199100645211970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         191010t20192019enka    s     000 0 eng d  z9781783747986 (Hardback)  z9781783747979 (Paperback)  a9781783747993q(pdf)  a9781783748006q(epub)  a9781783748013q(mobi)  a9781783748020q(XML)  z2399-6668 (Print)   a2399-6676 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1124606173   aStSaULbengerda00aEngaging researchers with data managementh[electronic resource] :bthe cookbook /cConnie Clare, Maria Cruz, Elli Papadopoulou, James Savage, Marta Teperek, Yan Wang, Iza Witkowska, and Joanne Yeomans. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2019. 4c©2019  a1 online resource (170 pages) :b25 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen reports seriesx2399-6676vvol. 8  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

However, many researchers are unfamiliar with RDM best practices, and research support staff are faced with the difficult task of delivering support to researchers across different disciplines and career stages. What strategies can institutions use to solve these problems? Engaging Researchers with Data Management is an invaluable collection of 24 case studies, drawn from institutions across the globe, that demonstrate clearly and practically how to engage the research community with RDM. These case studies together illustrate the variety of innovative strategies research institutions have developed to engage with their researchers about managing research data. Each study is presented concisely and clearly, highlighting the essential ingredients that led to its success and challenges encountered along the way. By interviewing key staff about their experiences and the organisational context, the authors of this book have created an essential resource for organisations looking to increase engagement with their research communities. This handbook is a collaboration by research institutions, for research institutions. It aims not only to inspire and engage, but also to help drive cultural change towards better data management. It has been written for anyone interested in RDM, or simply, good research practice."--Publisher's website. 0aResearchxData processing. 0aResearchxInformation technology. 0aDatabase management.1 aClare, Connie,econtributor.1 aCruz, Maria,econtributor.1 aPapadopoulou, Elli,econtributor.1 aSavage, James,econtributor.1 aTeperek, Marta,econtributor.1 aWang, Yan,econtributor.1 aWitkowska, Iza,econtributor.1 aYeomanns, Joanne,econtributor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen reports series ;vv. 8.x2399-667640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0185zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0185.jpgzConnect to cover image03433nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000390030624501100034526400470045526400110050230000340051333600260054733700260057333800360059950000440063550600480067953800360072754001650076350400570092850503770098552013170136260000550267960000550273465000230278971000380281285600570285085600920290799100645228970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         190927t20192019enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783747801 (hbk.)  z9781783747795 (pbk.)  a9781783747818q(pdf)  a9781783747825q(epub)  a9781783747832q(mobi)  a9781783747849q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1123108894  aStSaULbengerda1 aScrepanti, Ernesto,d1948-eauthor.10aLabour and valueh[electronic resource] :brethinking Marx's theory of exploitation /cErnesto Screpanti. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (144 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

With precision and clarity, he identifies the holes in traditional readings of Marx's theory before advancing his own original interpretation, drawing on contemporary philosophy and economic theory to provide a refreshingly interdisciplinary exegesis. Screpanti's arguments are delivered with perspicuity and verve: this is a book that aims to spark a debate. He exposes ambiguities present in Marx's exposition of his own theory, especially when dealing with the employment contract and the notions of 'abstract labor' and 'labor value', and he argues that these ambiguities have given rise to misunderstandings in previous analyses of Marx's theory of exploitation. Screpanti's own interpretation is a meticulously argued counterpoint to these traditional interpretations. Labour and Value is a significant contribution to the theory of economics, particularly Marxist economics. It will also be of great interest to scholars in other disciplines including sociology, political science, and moral and political philosophy. Screpanti's clear and engaging writing style will attract the interested general reader as well as the academic theorist."--Publisher's website. 10aMarx, Karld1818-1883xContributions in economics.10aMarx, Karld1818-1883xPolitical and social views. 0aMarxian economics.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0182zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0182.jpgzConnect to cover image04827nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027204000210029824501780031924600190049726400460051626400110056230000670057333600260064033700260066633800360069250000440072850600480077253800360082054001660085650400390102250512870106152015740234865000330392265000200395565000270397565000290400265000210403165000270405270000300407970000360410971000380414585600580418385600920424199100646295970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         221018t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800647503 (Hardback)  z9781800647497 (Paperback)  a9781800647510q(pdf)  a9781800647558q(HTML)  a9781800647541q(XML)  a9781800647527q(epub)  a9781800647534q(azw3)  aStSaULbengerda00aLife, re-scaledh[electronic resource] :bthe biological imagination in twenty-first-century literature and performance /cedited by Liliane Campos and Pierre-Louis Patoine.3 aLife, rescaled 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xvi, 402 pages) :b60 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

The gathered case studies investigate how recent creative work reframes the human within microscopic or macroscopic scales, from cellular biology to systems ecology, and engages with the ethical, philosophical, and political issues raised by the twenty-first century's shifting views of life. The collection thus examines literature and performance as spaces that shape our contemporary biological imagination. Comprised of thirteen chapters by an international group of academics, Life, Re-Scaled: The Biological Imagination in Twenty-First-Century Literature and Performance engages with four main areas of biological study: 'Invisible scales: cells, microbes and mycelium', 'Neuro-medical imaging and diagnosis', 'Pandemic imaginaries', and 'Ecological scales'. The authors examine these concepts in emerging forms such as plant theatre, climate change art, ecofiction and pandemic fiction, including the work of Jeff Vandermeer, Jon McGregor, Jeff Lemire, and Extinction Rebellion's Red Rebel Brigade performances. This valuable resource moves beyond the biological paradigms that were central to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, to outline the specificity of a contemporary imagination. Life, Re-Scaled is crucial reading for academics, scholars, and authors alike, as it proposes an unprecedented overview of the relationship between literature, performance and the life sciences in the twenty-first century."--Publisher's website. 0aLife sciences in literature. 0aEcology in art. 0aEcology in literature. 0aLiterature and medicine. 0aPerforming arts. 0aLife sciencesxIn art.1 aCampos, Liliane,eeditor.1 aPatoine, Pierre-Louis,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0303zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0303.jpgzConnect to cover image04341nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021004000210023304100130025404300210026710000300028824501780031826400470049626400110054330000400055433600260059433700260062033800360064649000670068250000440074950600480079353800360084154001490087750000700102650000920109650400670118850502750125554600640153052017030159460000900329765000370338765000510342465000300347571000750350571000380358083000560361885600570367485600920373199100647046970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         221021t20222022enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800647237 (hbk.)  z9781800647220 (pbk.)  a9781800647244q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaara  aa-mk---af-tz---1 aMorano, Roberta,eauthor.10aDiachronic variation in the Omani Arabic vernacular of the Al-ʿAwābī Districth[electronic resource] :bfrom Carl Reinhardt (1894) to the present day /cRoberta Morano. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2022] 4c©2022  a1 online resource (viii, 296 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 14  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under an Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This German-authored work was prolific in shaping our knowledge of Omani Arabic during the twentieth century, until the 1980s when more recent linguistic studies on the Arabic varieties spoken in Oman began to appear. Motivated by an urgent need to expand and reinforce our understanding of Omani Arabic, the book provides a linguistic analysis of the Omani vernacular spoken in the al-ʿAwābī district (northern Oman), based on the speech of fifteen informants recruited throughout the area. It also provides a comparative analysis of the new data with that collected by Carl Reinhardt in 1894. This comparison enables the reader to appreciate the extent of diachronic linguistic variation in the region, and also sheds light on the threats that such variation poses to Omani-specific linguistic features. Organised in four chapters, the book presents a sociolinguistic analysis of the Omani linguistic landscape followed by an examination of the phonology, morphology, and syntax of the al-ʿAwābī vernacular. Each chapter contains primary data collected by the author in situ compared, when applicable, with Carl Reinhardt's materials. The appendix includes two sample texts extrapolated from the recordings, fourteen proverbs and one traditional song. This study will be of interest to those working in the fields of Omani Arabic, historical and comparative linguistics, translation and interpretation, or those with an interest in how languages develop over time."--Publisher's website. 10aReinhardt, Carl,d1856-1903.tArabischer Dialekt gesprochen in ʻOmān und Zanzibar. 0aArabic languagexDialectszOman. 0aArabic languagexDialectszTanzaniazZanzibar. 0aArabic languagexGrammar.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 14.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0298zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0298.jpgzConnect to cover image03471nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602200220016102200230018303500230020604000210022910000310025024501070028125000250038826400470041326400110046030000340047133600260050533700260053133800360055749000510059350000440064450600480068853800360073654001650077250002140093750000280115150001070117950500720128652011680135865000450252665000430257165000400261465000400265465000450269471000380273983000510277785600570282885600920288599100647439970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         191029t20192019enk     s     000 0 eng d  z9781783747764 (pbk.)  a9781783747771q(pdf)  z2397-1126 (Print)  a2397-1134 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1132299958   aStSaULbengerda1 aSiklos, S.

STEP is an examination used by Cambridge Colleges for conditional offers in mathematics. They are also used by some other UK universities and many mathematics departments recommend that their applicants practice on the past papers even if they do not take the examination. Advanced Problems in Mathematics bridges the gap between school and university mathematics, and prepares students for an undergraduate mathematics course. The questions analysed in this book are all based on past STEP questions and each question is followed by a comment and a full solution. The comments direct the reader's attention to key points and put the question in its true mathematical context. The solutions point students to the methodology required to address advanced mathematical problems critically and independently. This book is a must read for any student wishing to apply to scientific subjects at university level and for anyone interested in advanced mathematics."--Publisher's website. 0aMathematicsxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aMathematicsvProblems, exercises, etc. 0aCalculusvProblems, exercises, etc. 0aGeometryvProblems, exercises, etc. 0aProbabilitiesxProblems, exercises, etc.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOBP series in mathematics ;vv. 4.x2387-1134 40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0181zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0181.jpgzConnect to cover image05545nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028504300120030624501420031826400470046026400110050730000630051833600260058133700260060733800360063350000440066950600480071353800360076154001650079750400410096250513660100352022420236965000340461165000250464565000430467065100500471370000390476370000370480270000370483971000380487685600570491485600920497199100650375970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         190927t20192019enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783748228 (hbk.)  z9781783748211 (pbk.)  a9781783748235q(pdf)  a9781783748242q(epub)  a9781783748259q(mobi)  a9781783748266q(XML)  a(OcoLC)1130040848  aStSaULbengerda  aa-io---00aInfrastructure investment in Indonesiah[electronic resource] :ba focus on ports /cColin Duffield, Felix Kin Peng Hui and Sally Wilson. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (396 pages) :b103 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This interdisciplinary collection-spanning the disciplines of engineering, law and planning-draws helpfully on a range of practical and theoretical perspectives. It is the collaborative effort of leading experts in the fields of infrastructure project initiation and financing, and is based on international research conducted by the University of Melbourne, Universitas Indonesia and Universitas Gadjah Mada.  The volume opens with a macroscopic perspective, outlining the broader economic situations confronting Indonesia and Australia, before adopting a more microscopic perspective to closely examine the issues surrounding major infrastructure investment in both countries. Detailed case studies are provided, key challenges are identified, and evidence-based solutions are offered. These solutions respond to such topical issues as how to overcome delays in infrastructure project initiation; how to enhance project decision-making for the selection and evaluation of projects; how to improve overall efficiency in the arrangement of project finance and governance; and how to increase the return provided by investment in infrastructure. Special focus is given to proposed improvements to the portal cities of Indonesia in the areas of major infrastructure project governance, policies, engagement, operation and processes. By rigorously investigating the economic, transport, finance and policy aspects of infrastructure investment, this book will be a valuable resource for policy makers and government officials in Indonesia and Australia, infrastructure investment organisations, and companies involved in exporting services between Indonesia and Australia. This book will also be of interest to researchers and students of infrastructure planning and financing, setting a solid foundation for subsequent investigations of financing options for large-scale infrastructure developments."--Publisher's website.  0aHarborszIndonesiaxPlanning. 0aHarborszManagement. 0aInfrastructure (Economics)zIndonesia. 0aIndonesiaxEconomic conditionsy21st century.1 aDuffield, C.

Showcasing the collective work of ten experienced scholars in the field, the book goes beyond concepts of tradition that have often been the focus of previous research, to explain how political, economic and technological changes in Russia have created a wide range of new possibilities and constraints in the pursuit of different ways of life. Each contribution is drawn from meticulous first-hand field research, and the authors engage with theoretical questions such as whether and how the concept of lifestyle can be extended beyond its conventionally urban, Euro-American context and employed in a markedly different setting. Lifestyle in Siberia and the Russian North builds on the contributors' clear commitment to diversifying the field and providing a novel and intimate insight into this vast and dynamic region. This book provides inspiring reading for students and teachers of Anthropology, Sociology and Cultural Studies and for anyone interested in Russia and its regions. By providing ethnographic case studies, it is also a useful basis for teaching anthropological methods and concepts, both at graduate and undergraduate level. Rigorous and innovative, it marks an important contribution to the study of Siberia and the Russian North."--Publisher's website.  0aSiberia (Russia)xSocial life and customs. 0aSiberia (Russia)xSocial conditions. 0aRussia, NorthernxSocial life and customs. 0aRussia, NorthernxSocial conditions.1 aHabeck, Joachim Otto,eeditor,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0171zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0171.jpgzConnect to cover image05322nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028504300120030624502090031826400470052726400110057430000620058533600260064733700260067333800360069950000440073550600480077953800360082754001650086350001030102850400410113150512110117252019570238365000400434065000380438065000180441865000420443670000390447870000350451770000350455270000420458771000380462985600570466785600920472499100652430970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         191212t20192019enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783748648 (hbk.)  z9781783748631 (pbk.)  a9781783748655q(pdf)  a9781783748662q(epub)  a9781783748679q(mobi)  a9781783748686q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1171068233  aStSaULbengerda  aa-io---00aNon-communicable disease preventionh[electronic resource] :bbest buys, wasted buys and contestable buys /cedited by Wanrudee Isaranuwatchai, Rachel A.

Each day NCDs cause more than 100,000 deaths, 80% of which occur in low- and middle-income countries. NCDs, however, are largely preventable, and a great deal of technical knowledge exists about how to prevent and manage them. Why, then, have we, as a global community, not been more successful at reducing this NCD burden? Does a universal problem not have a universal solution? Created by an international consortium of experts, this informative and accessible book provides practical guidelines, key learning points, and dynamic, real-world case studies to aid NCD program managers, policy officers and decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries, so that they can assess interventions for the prevention and control of NCDs. The book was commissioned by the Prince Mahidol Award Conference (PMAC), an annual international conference centred on policy of global significance related to public health. Non-Communicable Disease Prevention: Best Buys, Wasted Buys and Contestable Buys emphasises the importance of context in NCD control and prevention, arguing that the success of an intervention lies in an ability to respond to local needs and environments. The book comprises ten chapters, which collectively explore the reasons behind, and strategies for, preventing and managing the NCD burden. It spans key themes such as political economy, the transferability of economic evidence, the role of cross-sectoral policies, the importance of deliberative processes, and health technology assessment. This book is written for the benefit of the global health community, and is primarily targeted at those individuals who are involved in NCD programs. This book will also be of interest to NCD champions, policy advocates, and educators spearheading the movement for increased visiblity of NCDs."--Publisher's website.  0aMedicine, PreventivevCase studies. 0aPublic healthxPolitical aspects. 0aWorld health. 0aEconomic developmentxHealth aspects.1 aIsaranuwatchai, Wanrudee,eeditor.1 aArcher, Rachel,cDr.,eeditor.1 aTeerawattananon, Yot,eeditor.1 aCulyer, A.

'Fragile States' in an Unequal World: The Role of the g7+ in International Diplomacy and Development Cooperation introduces the members of the g7+, a group formed by 20 conflict-affected states: why they came to believe in politics and policy; how they feel about their work, their family and their communities; and what they want to leave behind for the next generations. It is the story of their personal and collective values, their mistakes, and the challenges they faced, and it will resonate with anyone who has tried to organize and work with a group of very different people. This book is also a contribution for those seeking to influence international policy, especially from a disadvantageous position. It explores how to find your voice, use your survival skills, work with passion, decide how much to concede and act responsibly. Together, these lessons illuminate the paths that individual members have walked as they found their own voices, as well as how the g7+ fights to speak collectively. The book ends with a glimpse of the way forward, as Isabel Rocha de Siqueira encourages younger generations to engage with politics and policy generously, with hope for the future.  Combining literature and hard facts - along with other elements such as illustrations, cartoon strips and photographs to tell the previously untold stories of public servants in poor, conflict-affected countries, the book offers an original (and very human) micro and macro perspective on the politics of development. It will be of interest to professionals in major development organisations, students and professors in development courses, policymakers, public servants, civil society, activists working for major international NGOs, and journalists who report on the development industry, as well as those with a general interest in international development cooperation, international diplomacy and other related fields."--Publisher's website. 0aSustainable developmentzDeveloping countries. 0aEconomic assistancezDeveloping countries. 0aInternational economic relations. 0aDeveloping countriesxEconomic policy. 0aDeveloping countriesxPolitics and government.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0311zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0311.jpgzConnect to cover image04798nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032004300220034124501400036326400460050326400110054930000600056033600260062033700260064633800360067250000440070850600480075253800360080054001660083650400530100250512240105552016620227965100310394165100290397265100290400165100290403070000290405970000400408871000380412885600580416685600920422499100661041970896620250313114119.0m     o  d        cr  n         221104t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643635 (Hardback)  z9781800643628 (Paperback)  a9781800643642q(pdf)  a9781800649439q(HTML)  a9781800643673q(XML)  a9781800643659q(epub)  a9781800643666q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1350687125  aStSaULbengerda  aae------aa------00aAnthropology of transformationh[electronic resource] :bfrom Europe to Asia and back /cedited by Juraj Buzalka and Agnieszka Pasieka. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xxviii, 252 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

With the thirtieth anniversary of the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 2019 as their catalyst, the authors reflect upon Chris Hann's lifelong fieldwork in the discipline, spanning regions as diverse as East Central Europe, Turkey, and the Chinese north-west. The collapse of the Berlin Wall naturally triggered a plethora of analysis and scholarly research. Sociocultural anthropology, with its focus on ethnographic study and on the gradual evolution of social relations, sharply contrasted with the emphasis on dramatic rupture brought about by the 1989 transition. Continuing in this tradition, this volume, through micro-level analysis of societal transformation from the post-war years to the present day, provides an alternative perspective to the neoliberalist views often encountered in the scholarship on political and economic modernisation. The more nuanced analysis of social transformations proposed here is a particularly useful tool in the investigation of contemporary issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the refugee 'crisis', and the rise of right-wing populism in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Anthropology of Transformation will be of interest to researchers in the fields of socio-cultural anthropology, religion and economics. Moreover, the book's discussion of issues widely discussed beyond the field of academia such as neoliberalism and the welfare state, and populist and exclusionary politics, will appeal to non-specialist readers."--Publisher's website. 0aEuropexSocial conditions. 0aAsiaxSocial conditions. 0aEuropexRelationszAsia. 0aAsiaxRelationszEurope.1 aBuzalka, Juraj,eeditor.1 aPasieka, Agnieszka,d1983-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0282zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0282.jpgzConnect to cover image05060nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000360030624501060034226400470044826400110049530000620050633600260056833700260059433800360062050000440065650600480070053800360074854001650078450400410094950512540099052021530224465000290439765000250442671000380445185600570448985600920454699100667618970896620250313114127.0m        d        cr  n         191216t20192019enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783748105 (hbk.)  z9781783748099 (pbk.)  a9781783748112q(pdf)  a9781783748129q(epub)  a9781783748136q(mobi)  a9781783748143q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1132420685  aStSaULbengerda1 aRibó, Ignasi,d1971-eauthor.10aProse fictionh[electronic resource] :ban introduction to the semiotics of narrative /cIgnasi Ribo. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (262 pages) :b45 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

It is intended as a high-school and college-level introduction to the central concepts of narrative theory - concepts that will aid students in developing their competence not only in analysing and interpreting short stories and novels, but also in writing them. This textbook prioritises clarity over intricacy of theory, equipping its readers with the necessary tools to embark on further study of literature, literary theory and creative writing. Building on a 'semiotic model of narrative,' it is structured around the key elements of narratological theory, with chapters on plot, setting, characterisation, and narration, as well as on language and theme - elements which are underrepresented in existing textbooks on narrative theory. The chapter on language constitutes essential reading for those students unfamiliar with rhetoric, while the chapter on theme draws together significant perspectives from contemporary critical theory (including feminism and postcolonialism). This textbook is engaging and easily navigable, with key concepts highlighted and clearly explained, both in the text and in a full glossary located at the end of the book. Throughout the textbook the reader is aided by diagrams, images, quotes from prominent theorists, and instructive examples from classical and popular short stories and novels (such as Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis", J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter, or Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, amongst many others). Prose Fiction: An Introduction to the Semiotics of Narrative can either be incorporated as the main textbook into a wider syllabus on narrative theory and creative writing, or it can be used as a supplementary reference book for readers interested in narrative fiction. The textbook is a must-read for beginning students of narratology, especially those with no or limited prior experience in this area. It is of especial relevance to English and Humanities major students in Asia, for whom it was conceived and written."--Publisher's website.  0aStorytellingxTechnique. 0aNarration (Rhetoric)2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0187zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0187.jpgzConnect to cover image04083nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025504100130027624501520028926400470044126400110048830000400049933600260053933700260056533800360059149000670062750000440069450600480073853800360078654001660082250000700098850000920105850400660115050511090121654600640232552006720238963000350306165000130309665000300310970000340313970000330317370000290320671000750323571000380331083000560334885600570340485600920346199100670342970896620250313114124.0m     o  d        cr  n         221121t20222022enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800649200 (hbk.)  z9781800649194 (pbk.)  a9781800649217q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1350687899  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaheb00aStudies in the Masoretic tradition of the Hebrew Bibleh[electronic resource] /cedited by Daniel J.

The papers are innovative studies of a range of aspects of this Masoretic tradition at various periods, many of them presenting hitherto unstudied primary sources. They focus on traditions of vocalisation signs and accent signs, traditions of oral reading, traditions of Masoretic notes, as well as Rabbinic and exegetical texts.

Building on conversations initiated in Women and Migration: Responses in Art and History, this edited volume features a range of written styles, from memoir to artists' statements to journalistic and critical essays. The collection shows how women's experiences of migration have been articulated through art, film, poetry and even food. This varied approach aims to aid understanding of the lived experiences of home, loss, family, belonging, isolation, borders and identity-issues salient both in experiences of migration and in the epochal times in which we find ourselves today. These are stories of trauma and fear, but also stories of the strength, perseverance, hope and even joy of women surviving their own moments of disorientation, disenfranchisement and dislocation. This collection engages with current issues in an effort to deepen understanding, encourage ongoing reflection and build a more just future. It will appeal to artists and scholars of the humanities, social sciences, and public policy, as well as general readers with an interest in women's experiences of migration."--Publisher's website. 0aWomen immigrants. 0aWomen immigrantsvCross-cultural studies.1 aBrooks, Kalia,eeditor.1 aFinley, Cheryl,eeditor.1 aToscano, Ellyn,eeditor.1 aWillis, Deborah,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0296zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0296.jpgzConnect to cover image04255nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025510000290027624502030030526400470050826400110055530000400056633600260060633700260063233800360065849000670069450000440076150600480080553800360085354001660088950000700105550000920112550400530121750503240127052016880159463000250328263000390330765000230334665000270336970000330339671000750342971000380350483000560354285600570359885600940365599100672640970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         221129t20222022enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800647640 (hbk.)  z9781800647633 (pbk.)  a9781800647657q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1352973669  aStSaULbengerda1 aWaller, Daniel,eauthor.14aThe Bible in the bowlsh[electronic resource] :ba catalogue of biblical quotations in published Jewish Babylonian Aramaic magic bowls /cDaniel James Waller ; with a contribution from Dorota Molin. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2022] 4c©2022  a1 online resource (viii, 188 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 16  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0).

As our only direct epigraphic witnesses to the Hebrew Bible from late antique Babylonia, the bowls are uniquely placed to contribute to research on the (oral) transmission of the biblical text in late antiquity; the pre-Masoretic Babylonian vocalisation tradition; the formation of the liturgy and the early development of the Jewish prayer book; the social locations of biblical knowledge in late antique Babylonia and socio-religious typologies of the bowls; and the dynamics of scriptural citation in ancient Jewish magic. In a number of cases, the bowls also contain the earliest attestations of biblical verses not found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Pre-dating the next available evidence by four to five centuries, the bowls are a valuable resource for biblical text critics. By making these valuable witnesses to the Hebrew Bible easily available to scholars, The Bible in the Bowls is designed to facilitate further research by linguists, liturgists, biblical text critics, and students of Jewish magic. It collates and transcribes each biblical verse as it appears in the published bowls, furnishes details of the bowls' publication, and notes various features of interest. The catalogue is also accompanied by an accessible introduction that briefly introduces the incantation bowls, surveys their deployment of scripture in light of their magical goals, and discusses the orthography of the quotations and what this can tell us about the encounter with the biblical text in late antique Babylonia."--Publisher's website. 00aMasorahvQuotations.00aBible.pOld TestamentvQuotations. 0aIncantation bowls. 0aJudaismxSacred books.1 aMolin, Dorota,econtributor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 16.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0305zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0305.jpgzConnect to cover image  03401nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032010000590034124500780040026400460047826400110052430000630053533600260059833700260062433800360065050000440068650600480073053800360077854001490081450000320096350000800099550400670107550502690114252011430141165000280255465000340258265000340261665000320265065000380268271000380272085600570275885600920281599100673395970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         221206t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643932 (Hardback)  z9781800643925 (Paperback)  a9781800643949q(pdf)  a9781800646728q(HTML)  a9781800643970q(XML)  a9781800643956q(epub)  a9781800643963q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1352989697  aStSaULbengerda1 aCobussen, Marcel,d1962-eauthor,ecomposer,ecurator.10aEngaging with everyday soundsh[electronic resource] /cMarcel Cobussen.  1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (118 pages) :b36 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Marcel Cobussen intertwines sonic studies with philosophy, sound art, sociology and more to create an impressively lucid and innovative guide to sonic materialism, calling for a re-sensitization to our acoustic environment and arguing that everyday sounds have (micro)political, social, and ethical impact to which we should attend. Exploring the intellectual history of sound studies as well as local, global, and temporal sonic geographies, Cobussen weaves audio files, images, and journal excerpts into his work to create a multimodal monograph that explores the relationships of humans, nonhumans, and their environments through sound. This accessible and interdisciplinary collection of short, powerful essays will be valuable reading for both academics and the general reader interested in sound studies, sound art, philosophy, or the sociology of everyday life-and for anyone keen to think about the sonic in new and engaging ways."--Publisher's website. 0aSoundxSocial aspects.  0aSoundxPsychological aspects. 0aSoundxEnvironmental aspects. 0aListeningxSocial aspects.  0aListeningxPsychological aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0288zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0288.jpgzConnect to cover image03631nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027204000210029810000290031924501030034826400460045126400110049730000670050833600260057533600330060133700260063433800360066050000440069650600480074053800360078854001660082450400530099050503950104352014980143860000330293665000410296971000380301085600570304885600920310599100673414970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         221206t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800647572 (Hardback)  z9781800647565 (Paperback)  a9781800647589q(pdf)  a9781800647626q(HTML)  a9781800647619q(XML)  a9781800647596q(epub)  a9781800647602q(azw3)  aStSaULbengerda1 aEvans, Dorinda,eauthor.10aWilliam Rimmerh[electronic resource] :bchampion of imagination in American art /cDorinda Evans. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (x, 240 pages) :b145 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Rimmer cultivated an art of ideas and personal expression whilst supporting himself as a physician and, later, as a teacher of art anatomy at the Cooper Union School of Design for Women in New York. Unlike his contemporaries, he advocated the creation of sculpture drawn entirely from the artist's imagination, as opposed to antique archetypes or live models. In this way, he sought to reframe excellence in American art as something that must be found within, rather than derived from Europe. In this new monograph, the meaning of Rimmer's works is for the first time considered from a combination of perspectives, such as close visual analysis (including X-ray and infrared), historical documentation, and social context. These are enriched with discussion of the artist's own bipolar disorder, deeply-held spiritualism, and views on gender equality-considering women just as talented as men, he used naked male models in all-female classes long before his contemporaries, and produced an allegorical sculpture of fighting lions that criticized the tyranny of men over women. This book will be of great interest to academics, students, art museums, collectors, dealers, art historians, and members of the public with an affinity for Rimmer's work. It will also appeal to those with a broader interest in American culture."--Publisher's website.10aRimmer, William,d1816-1879. 0aSculptorszUnited StatesvBiography.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0304zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0304.jpgzConnect to cover image03567nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032010000340034124500950037526400460047026400110051630000820052733600260060933600330063533700260066833800360069450000440073050600480077453800360082254001820085850000650104050400530110550504490115852011900160765000340279765000270283165000190285865000210287771000380289885600570293685600920299399100682084970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         221209t20222022enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800647367 (Hardback)  z9781800647350 (Paperback)  a9781800647374q(pdf)  a9781800647411q(HTML)  a9781800647404q(XML)  a9781800647381q(epub)  a9781800647398q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1361809219  aStSaULbengerda1 aJan, Steven Bradley,eauthor.10aMusic in evolutionh[electronic resource] :band evolution in music /cSteven Bradley Jan. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xxxiii, 773 pages) :b61 colour illustrations, 17 tables.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) For more detailed information consult the publisher's website.  aAdditional resources available from the publisher's website.  aIncludes bibliography (pages 627-702) and index.0 aPreface / Steven Jan -- 1.

Examining the 'evolutionary algorithm' that drives biological and musical-cultural evolution, the book provides a distinctive commentary on how musicality and music can shed light on our understanding of Darwin's famous theory, and vice-versa. Comprised of seven chapters, with several musical examples, figures and definitions of terms, this original and accessible book is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the relationships between music and evolutionary thought. Jan guides the reader through key evolutionary ideas and the development of human musicality, before exploring cultural evolution, evolutionary ideas in musical scholarship, animal vocalisations, music generated through technology, and the nature of consciousness as an evolutionary phenomenon. A unique examination of how evolutionary thought intersects with music, Music in Evolution and Evolution in Music is essential to our understanding of how and why music arose in our species and why it is such a significant presence in our lives."--Publisher's website. 0aMusicxPsychological aspects. 0aMusicxSocial aspects. 0aMusicxOrigin. 0aHuman evolution.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0301zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0301.jpgzConnect to cover image06881nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032024501420034126400460048326400110052930000790054033600260061933600330064533700260067833800360070450000440074050600480078453800360083254001660086850000650103450400510109950536420115052013130479265000420610565000520614770000370619971000380623685600570627485600920633199100682097970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         221209t20222022enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648579 (Hardback)  z9781800648562 (Paperback)  a9781800648586q(pdf)  a9781800648623q(HTML)  a9781800648616q(XML)  a9781800648593q(epub)  a9781800648609q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1355379612  aStSaULbengerda00aTransforming conservationh[electronic resource] :ba practical guide to evidence and decision making /cedited by William J.

In this book an international team of experts provide solutions. The transformation suggested includes rethinking how evidence is assessed, combined, communicated and used in decision-making; using effective methods when asking experts to make judgements (i.e. avoiding just asking an expert or a group of experts!); using a structured process for making decisions that incorporate the evidence and having effective processes for learning from actions. In each case, the specific problem with decision making is described with a range of practical solutions. Adopting this approach to decision-making requires societal change so detailed suggestions are made for transforming organisations, governments, businesses, funders and philanthropists. The practical suggestions include twelve downloadable checklists. The vision of the authors is to transform conservation so it is more effective, more cost-efficient, learns from practice and is more attractive to funders. However, the lessons of this important book go well beyond conservation to decision-makers in any field."--Publisher's website. 0aNature conservationxDecision making. 0aNatural resourcesxManagementxDecision making.1 aSutherland, William J.,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0321zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0321.jpgzConnect to cover image06420nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602200220027202200230029403500220031704000210033924506730036026400460103326400110107930000780109033600260116833600330119433700260122733800360125349000700128950000440135950600480140353800360145154001660148750400510165350521230170452015820382765000370540965000290544665000330547565000340550870000310554270000280557370000330560171000380563483000690567285600570574185600920579899100682105970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr##n#########221209t20222022enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648227 (Hardback)  z9781800648210 (Paperback)  a9781800648234q(pdf)  a9781800648272q(HTML)  a9781800648265q(XML)  a9781800648241q(epub)  a2755-2616 (Print)  a2755-2624 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1357153562  aStSaULbengerda00aLandscapes of investigationh[electronic resource] :bcontributions to critical mathematics education /cedited by Miriam Godoy Penteado and Ole Skovsmos ; contributions by Adriana Lima, Agustín Méndez, Amanda Moura, Ana Carolina Faustino, Arindam Bose, Bülent Avcı, Daniela Soares, Débora Souza-Carneiro, Denner Barros, Edyenis Frango, Fanny Rodríguez, Fátima Oliveira, Guilherme Gomes da Silva, Íria Gaviolli, Jeimy Suaréz, Lessandra Marcelly, Lucicleide Bezerra, Manuella Carrijo, Mario Sánchez Aguilar, Miriam Penteado, Ole Skovsmose, Paula Civiero, Rafaela da Silva, Raquel Milani, Reginaldo Britto, Rejane Julio, Renato Ribeiro and Yael Moren. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xii, 348 pages) :b26 colour illustrations, 14 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aStudies on mathematics education and societyx2755-2624 ;vvol. 1  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0).

It enables us to organise educational processes so that students and teachers are able to get involved in explorations guided by dialogical interactions. It attempts to address explicit or implicit forms of social injustice by means of mathematics, and also to promote a critical conception of mathematics, challenging the assumption that the subject represents objectivity and neutrality. Landscapes of Investigation provides many illustrations of how this can be done in primary, secondary, and university education. It also illustrates how exploring landscapes of investigation can contribute to mathematics teacher education programmes. This edited volume is the result of a collaboration established through the Colloquium in Research in Critical Mathematics Education, which took place in 2016, 2018, and 2019 in Brazil. Its twenty-eight contributors are young researchers from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, India, Mexico and the USA, who are dedicated to the further development of critical mathematics education. Organised in eighteen chapters, the volume presents examples of engaging students from a diversity of social and economic backgrounds, age ranges, and abilities across different countries. The chapters present original findings on the social aspects of all levels of mathematics education. Landscapes of Investigation is of particular relevance to those with an interest in the potential of mathematics education to challenge social injustices."--Publisher's website. 0aMathematicsxStudy and teaching. 0aMathematicsxPhilosophy. 0aMathematicsxSocial aspects. 0aSocial justice and education.1 aPenteado, Miriam,eeditor.1 aSkovsmos, Ole,eeditor.1 aLima, Adriana,econtributor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aStudies on mathematics education and society ;vv. 1.x2755-262440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0316zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0316.jpgzConnect to cover image05708nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032024501440034125000200048526400460050526400110055130000800056233600260064233700260066833800360069450000440073050600480077453800360082254001660085850001640102450000630118850518250125152016790307665000510475565000370480665000530484370000340489670000340493071000380496474000630500285600570506585600920512299100685978970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         221212t20222022enkad   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781800649064 (Hardback)  z9781800649057 (Paperback)  a9781800649071q(pdf)  a9781800649118q(HTML)  a9781800649101q(XML)  a9781800649088q(epub)  a9781800649095q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1357154908  aStSaULbengerda00aGreening Europeh[electronic resource] :b2022 European public investment outlook /cedited by Floriana Cerniglia and Francesco Saraceno.    a[Third edition] 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xxvi, 218 pages) :b57 colour illustrations, 17 tables.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Compelling data from key economists affiliated with international organizations like the International Monetary Fund, European Investment Bank and the European Commission, as well as academic departments and policy institutes are a clarion call for green investment to boost the economy and put the planet on a sustainable path. Like its predecessors, the book presents the issues in a lucid and navigable manner. Part I explores the EU's current levels of green public investment, as well as the challenges ahead in achieving net zero carbon emissions after years of decreasing funding and the obstacles presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The public investment trends of France, Germany, Italy and Spain are systematically evaluated, as well as the REPowerEU policy - accelerated in Spring 2022 - to move away from Russia's supply of fossil fuels. Part II focuses on the investment needed for green transition; the important economic and fiscal effects and benefits this would bring; and the reality of what is required before 2030 to achieve the EU's carbon-neutral targets by 2050. Greening Europe is essential reading for economists, environmentalists, and policymakers. It should also be of interest to anyone who wants to understand the cost implications of the 'carbon-neutral' policies that governments have promised, and the urgent need to change our approach towards energy usage."--Publisher's website. 0aPublic investmentsxGovernment policyzEurope. 0aEnvironmental economicszEurope. 0aEconomic developmentxGovernment policyzEurope.1 aCerniglia, Floriana,eeditor.1 aSaraceno, Francesco,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.4 aThe great reset : 2021 European public investment outlook.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0328zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0328.jpgzConnect to cover image05067nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032010000290034124501700037025000320054026400460057226400110061830000650062933600260069433700260072033800360074650000440078250600480082653800360087454001830091050001010109350000880119450001020128250400500138450511840143452015000261865000150411865000250413365000410415870000420419970000400424171000380428174000690431985600570438885600920444599100685990970896620250313114122.0m     o  d        cr  n         221212t20222022enkad   sb    000 0deng d  z9781800648500 (Hardback)  z9781800648494 (Paperback)  a9781800648517q(pdf)  a9781800648555q(HTML)  a9781800648548q(XML)  a9781800648524q(epub)  a9781800648531q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1357156066  aStSaULbengerda1 aHens, Kristien,eauthor.10aChance encountersh[electronic resource] :ba bioethics for a damaged planet /cKristien Hens ; Christina Stadlbauer (illustrator), Bart H.M.

As well as ethical, their role is conceptual: they can improve the quality and coherence of scientific research by ensuring that particular concepts are used consistently and thoughtfully across interdisciplinary projects. Hens argues that chance and uncertainty play a central part in bioethics, but that these qualities can be in tension with the attempt to establish a given theory as scientific knowledge: in describing organisms and practices, in a sense we create the world. Hens contends that this is necessarily an ethical activity. Examining genetic research, biomedical ethics, autism research and the concept of risk, Hens illustrates that there is no 'universal' or 'neutral' state of scientific and clinical knowledge, and that attending to the situatedness of individual experience is essential to understand the world around us, to know its (and our) limitations, and to forge an ethical future. Chance Encounters is aimed at a broad audience of researchers in bioethics, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, as well as biomedical and environmental scientists. It will also be relevant to policymakers, and the artwork by Christina Stadlbauer and Bartaku will be of interest to artists and writers working at the intersection of art and science."--Publisher's website. 0aBioethics. 0aBiologyxPhilosophy. 0aResearchxMoral and ethical aspects.1 aStadlbauer, Christina,eillustrator. 1 aVadenput, Bart H.

The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region is a particularly complex place to study: an area of economic contrasts with changing dietary patterns and stark differences between high levels of malnutrition and a prevalence of overweight and obesity. As a result, actions to improve the nutritional situation of the population are urgently sought. The strategies explored in this book offer a unique opportunity to change food systems all over the world, addressing aspects including sustainable food production, the impact of marketing and labelling on behaviour, and the effect of global events such as climate change, war and the COVID-19 pandemic. Reshaping Food Systems is an essential read at a time when malnutrition in all its forms, including undernourishment, micronutrient deficiencies and overweight and obesity, pose a serious threat to global health, and is of particular interest for policymakers working in nutrition and public health."--Publisher's website.20aWorld Health Organization.bRegional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. 0aNutrition policyzMediterranean Region. 0aNutrition policyzMiddle East. 0aFood productionzMediterranean Region. 0aFood productionzMiddle East.1 aMeyer, Alexa B.,eauthor.2 aWorld Health Organization.bRegional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0322zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0322.jpgzConnect to cover image04505nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025510000330027624501230030926400470043226400110047930000390049033600260052933700260055533800360058149000670061750000440068450600480072853800360077654001660081250000700097850000920104850400530114050509380119352014410213163000330357263000470360565000510365271000750370371000380377883000560381685600570387285600940392999100706674970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         230220t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800649811 (hbk.)  z9781800649804 (pbk.)  a9781800649828q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1369663912  aStSaULbengerda1 aHornkohl, Aaron D.,eauthor.14aThe historical depth of the Tiberian reading tradition of Biblical Hebrewh[electronic resource] /cAaron D.

Focusing on cases of dissonance between the tradition's written (consonantal) and reading (vocalic) components, the study shows that the Tiberian spelling and pronunciation traditions, though related, interdependent, and largely in harmony, at numerous points reflect distinct oral realisations of the biblical text. Where the extant vocalisation differs from the apparently pre-exilic pronunciation presupposed by the written tradition, the former often exhibits conspicuous affinity with post-exilic linguistic conventions as seen in representative Second Temple material, such as the core Late Biblical Hebrew books, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Ben Sira, rabbinic literature, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and contemporary Aramaic and Syriac material. On the one hand, such instances of written-reading disharmony clearly entail a degree of anachronism in the vocalisation of Classical Biblical Hebrew compositions. On the other, since many of the innovative and secondary features in the Tiberian vocalisation tradition are typical of sources from the Second Temple Period and, in some cases, are documented as minority alternatives in even earlier material, the Masoretic reading tradition is justifiably characterised as a linguistic artefact of profound historical depth."--Publisher's website. 00aMasorahxCriticism, Textual.00aBible.pOld TestamentxCriticism, Textual. 0aHebrew language, Post-BiblicalxPronunciation.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 17.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0310zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0310.jpgzConnect to cover image  04402nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032010000410034124501510038226400460053326400110057930000420059033600260063233600330065833700260069133800360071750000440075350600480079753800360084554001660088150000650104750400670111250508010117952016650198065000240364565000340366970000420370371000380374585600570378385600920384099100706682970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         230220t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800649316 (Hardback)  z9781800649309 (Paperback)  a9781800649323q(pdf)  a9781800649361q(HTML)  a9781800649354q(XML)  a9781800649330q(epub)  a9781800649347q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1370497119  aStSaULbengerda1 aGomendio, M.q(Montserrat),eauthor.10aDire straitsh[electronic resource] :beducation reforms, ideology, vested interests, and evidence /cMontserrat Gomendio and José Ignacio Wert. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2023. 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xviii, 344 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

To address the key question of why education reforms are so difficult, the authors take into account a broad range of relevant factors, such as governance, ideology, and stakeholder conflicts of interest, and their interactions with one another. Drawing on their experiences as policymakers in the Spanish government and as governmental advisors worldwide, Montserrat Gomendio and Jose Ignacio Wert produce a publication like no other, shifting the usual Eurocentric narrative and shedding light on frequently overlooked educational policies from elsewhere. In this context, they dive deeper into details of educational failures and successes, the processes of implementation and investment priorities in different countries. They provide revealing accounts of stakeholder conflicts of interest and the challenges of implementing educational reform during a financial crisis. The authors also investigate why the evidence from international large-scale assessments (ILSAs) has, contrary to expectation, not generated improvements in most education systems. Gomendio and Wert investigate the evolution of different education systems, closely examining their advances or declines. Gomendio and Wert's expert voices illuminate the current state of global education systems and the necessary changes to ensure long-awaited improvements. This is a revelatory and informative resource for policymakers, teachers and academics alike."--Publisher's website. 0aEducational change. 0aEducationxGovernment policy.1 aWert, José Ignacio,d1950-eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0332zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0332.jpgzConnect to cover image14977nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032004300120034124502190035326400460057226400110061830000680062933600260069733600330072333700260075633800360078250000440081850600480086253800360091054001660094650000650111250400510117750532090122850536330443750543310807052015741240165100261397565100211400170000261402270000271404870000281407570000291410370000301413270000311416270000311419371000381422485600571426285600921431999100707765970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         230224 20232023enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648715 (Hardback)  z9781800648708 (Paperback)  a9781800648722q(pdf)  a9781800648760q(HTML)  a9781800648753q(XML)  a9781800648739q(epub)  a9781800648746q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1370944474  aStSaULbengerda  ae------04aThe European experienceh[electronic resource] :ba multi-perspective history of modern Europe /cedited by Jan Hansen, Jochen Hung, Jaroslav Ira, Judit Klement, Sylvain Lesage, Juan Luis Simal and Andrew Tompkins. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2023. 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xx, 972 pages) :b73 illustrations, 1 table.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Offering a valuable corrective to the Anglocentric narratives of previous English-language textbooks, scholars from all over Europe have pooled their knowledge on comparative themes such as identities, cultural encounters, power and citizenship, and economic development to reflect the complexity and heterogeneous nature of the European experience. Rather than another grand narrative, the international author teams offer a multifaceted and rich perspective on the history of the continent of the past 500 years. Each major theme is dissected through three chronological sub-chapters, revealing how major social, political and historical trends manifested themselves in different European settings during the early modern (1500-1800), modern (1800-1900) and contemporary period (1900-2000). This resource is of utmost relevance to today's history students in the light of ongoing internationalisation strategies for higher education curricula, as it delivers one of the first multi-perspective and truly 'European' analyses of the continent's past. Beyond the provision of historical content, this textbook equips students with the intellectual tools to interrogate prevailing accounts of European history, and enables them to seek out additional perspectives in a bid to further enrich the discipline."--Publisher's website. 0aEuropexCivilization. 0aEuropexHistory.1 aHansen, Jan,eeditor.1 aHung, Jochen,eeditor.1 aIra, Jaroslav,eeditor.1 aKlement, Judit,eeditor.1 aLesage, Sylvain,eeditor.1 aSimal, Juan Luis,eeditor.1 aTompkins, Andrew,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0323zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0323.jpgzConnect to cover image05066nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032004100180034110000490035924000190040824500880042726400460051526400110056130000590057233600260063133700260065733800360068350000440071950600480076353800360081154001660084750400510101354601030106450514740116752015660264165000340420765000380424165000490427965000570432871000380438585600570442385600920448099100711237970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         230307 20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800647732 (Hardback)  z9781800647725 (Paperback)  a9781800647749q(pdf)  a9781800647787q(HTML)  a9781800647770q(XML)  a9781800647756q(epub)  a9781800647763q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1372397104  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghnonanon1 aPettit, Edward,d1968-eauthor,etranslator.10aEdda.lEnglish14aThe Poetic Eddah[electronic resource] :ba dual-language edition /cEdward Pettit. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2023. 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xvi, 878 pages) :b2 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Included are thirty-six texts, which are mostly preserved in medieval manuscripts, especially the thirteenth-century Icelandic codex traditionally known as the Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda. The poems cover diverse subjects, including the creation, destruction and rebirth of the world, the dealings of gods such as Óðinn, Þórr and Loki with giants and each other, and the more intimate, personal tragedies of the hero Sigurðr, his wife Guðrún and the valkyrie Brynhildr. Each poem is provided with an introduction, synopsis and suggestions for further reading. The Old Norse texts are furnished with a textual apparatus recording the manuscript readings behind this edition's emendations, as well as select variant readings. The accompanying translations, informed by the latest scholarship, are concisely annotated to make them as accessible as possible. As the first open-access, single-volume parallel Old Norse edition and English translation of the Poetic Edda, this book will prove a valuable resource for students and scholars of Old Norse literature. It will also interest those researching other fields of medieval literature (especially Old English and Middle High German), and appeal to a wider general audience drawn to the myths and legends of the Viking Age and subsequent centuries."--Publisher's website. 0aEddasxHistory and criticism. 0aEddasvTranslations into English. 0aOld Norse poetryvTranslations into English. 0aMythology, NorsexPoetryvTranslations into English.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0308zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0308.jpgzConnect to cover image03298nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500210029804000210031910000450034024500980038525000200048326400460050326400110054930000430056033600260060333700260062933800360065550000440069150600480073553800360078354001660081950000650098550400530105052014040110360000520250765000510255965000430261071000380265385600570269185600920274899100711245970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         230224 20232023enk     sb    001 0beng d  z9781800647169 (Hardback)  z9781800647152 (Paperback)  a9781800647176q(pdf)  a9781800647213q(HTML)  a9781800647206q(XML)  a9781800647183q(epub)  a9781800647190q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)741968808  aStSaULbengerda1 aGraham, P.

The book covers Isaacs' childhood through to the end of her life, making it of great interest to historians of British education and of psychoanalysis as well as to practicing early years teachers and psychoanalysts. Graham describes the origins of the theories behind Isaacs' work while also placing her contribution into context with other contemporary educationists. He draws on a range of sources including her own published and unpublished papers, multiple archives and intimate letters. Such wealth of information and anecdotes gives an insight into her childhood, marriage, and career creating a deeper understanding of both Isaacs' personal life and her achievements. As only the second biography on Isaacs, this book is a valuable resource that shines a light on the life of a figure who has often been neglected in this field of study. It provides a shift away from the various male-dominated accounts currently prevalent within this area of research. Susan Isaacs is crucial reading to raise our awareness and appreciation of the person behind the work, while also highlighting and celebrating the impact she has made on today's education and psychoanalytic practice."--Publisher's website.10aIsaacs, Susan Sutherland Fairhurst,d1885-1948. 0aChild psychologistszGreat BritainvBiography. 0aEducational psychologyzGreat Britain.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0297zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0297.jpgzConnect to cover image05044nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032004100130034104300120035410000340036624502290040024600460062926400460067526400110072130000760073233600260080833700260083433800360086050000440089650600480094053800360098854001660102450001460119050000200133654600930135650510530144952016670250265000410416970000660421070000280427671000380430474000350434285600570437785600920443499100727431970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         230317 20232023enkad   s     001 0 eng d  z9781800649910 (Hardback)  z9781800649903 (Paperback)  a9781800649927q(pdf)  a9781800649965q(HTML)  a9781800649958q(XML)  a9781800649934q(epub)  a9781800649941q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1372295823  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghyid  ae-pl---1 aLeshchinsky, Yankev,eauthor.14aThe last years of Polish Jewry.nVolume 1,pAt the edge of the abyss: essays, 1927-33h[electronic resource] /cby Yankev Leshchinsky ; translated by Robert Brym and Eli Jany ; edited and with an introduction by Robert Brym.3 aAt the edge of the abyss: essays, 1927-33 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2023. 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xxi, 156 pages) :b8 colour illustrations, 7 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Emigration tragedies / Yankev Leshchinsky, Robert Brym, Eli Jan.  a"Ukrainian-born Yankev Leshchinsky (1876-1966) was the leading scholarly and journalistic analyst of Eastern European Jewish socioeconomic and political life from the 1920s to the 1950s. Known as "the dean of Jewish sociologists" and "the father of Jewish demography," Leshchinsky published a series of insightful and moving essays in Yiddish on Polish Jewry between 1927 and 1937. Despite heightened interest in interwar Jewish communities in Poland in recent years, these essays (like most of Leshchinsky's works) have never been translated into English. The Last Years of Polish Jewry helps to rectify this situation by translating some of Leshchinsky's key essays. A thoughtful Introduction by Robert Brym provides the context of the author's life and work. The essays in this volume, based on years of research and first-hand observation, focus on the period 1927-33. The rise of militant Polish nationalism and the ensuing anti-Jewish boycotts and pogroms; the increasing exclusion of Jews from government employment and the universities; the destitution, hunger, suicide, and efforts to emigrate that characterized Jewish life; the psychological toll taken by mass uncertainty and hopelessness-all this falls within the author's ambit. There is no work in English that comes close to the range and depth of Leshchinsky's essays on the last years of the three million Polish Jews who were to perish at the hand of the Nazi regime. This book will be of interest to researchers and students of Eastern European history and society, especially those with an interest in Eastern Europe's Jewish communities on the brink of the Holocaust."--Publisher's website. 0aJewszPolandxHistoryy20th century.1 aBrym, Robert,etranslator,eeditor,ewriter of introduction. 1 aJany, Eli,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.4 aThe permanent pogrom, 1935-37.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0341zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0341.jpgzConnect to cover image03246nam a2200385 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017004000210019510000290021624501400024526400460038526400110043130000710044233600260051333700260053933800360056550000440060150600480064553800360069354001660072950400510089550504150094652012200136165000210258165000410260270000300264371000380267385600570271185600920276899100727580970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         230320 20232023enka    s     000 0 eng d  z9781800644113 (Hardback)  z9781800644106 (Paperback)  a9781800644120q(pdf)  aStSaULbengerda1 aSauter, Thomas,eauthor.10aIntroduction to systems biologyh[electronic resource] :bworkbook for flipped-classroom teaching /cThomas Sauter and Marco Albrecht.  1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2023. 4c©2023  a1 online resource (viii, 162 pages) :billustrations (some colour)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Physical modeling and non-linear enzyme / Thomas Sauter, Marco Albrecht.  a"This book is an introduction to the language of systems biology, which is spoken among many disciplines, from biology to engineering. Authors Thomas Sauter and Marco Albrecht draw on a multidisciplinary background and evidence-based learning to facilitate the understanding of biochemical networks, metabolic modeling and system dynamics. Their pedagogic approach briefly highlights core ideas of concepts in a broader interdisciplinary framework to guide a more effective deep dive thereafter. The learning journey starts with the purity of mathematical concepts, reveals its power to connect biological entities in structure and time, and finally introduces physics concepts to tightly align abstraction with reality. This workbook is all about self-paced learning, supports the flipped-classroom concept, and kick-starts with scientific evidence on studying. Each chapter comes with links to external YouTube videos, learning checklists, and Integrated real-world examples to gain confidence in thinking across scientific perspectives. The result is an integrated approach that opens a line of communication between theory and application, enabling readers to actively learn as they read."--Publisher's website. 0aSystems biology. 0aSystems biologyxStudy and teaching.1 aAlbrecht, Marco,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0291zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0291.jpgzConnect to cover image04092nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000260024702000250027303500220029804000210032010000310034124501710037224600300054326400470057326400110062030000710063133600260070233700330072833700260076133800360078750000440082350600480086753800360091554001660095150000650111750400550118250504280123752015260166565000300319165000500322165000160327165000310328765000320331871000380335074000370338885600570342585600920348299100742588970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         230421t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800649606 (hardback)  z9781800649590 (paperback)  a9781800649613q(pdf)  a9781800649651q(HTML)  a9781800649620q(epub)  a9781800649637q(AZW3)  a9781800649644q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1376377187  aStSaULbengerda1 aRudy, Kathryn M.,eauthor.10aTouching parchmenth[electronic resource] :bhow medieval users rubbed, handled, and kissed their manuscripts.nVol. 1,pOfficials and their books /cKathryn M.

The traces of its use through touching and handling during different rituals such as oath-taking, is the subject of Kathryn Rudy's research in Touching Parchment. Rudy presents numerous and fascinating case studies that relate to the evidence of use and damage through touching and or kissing. She also puts each study within a category of different ways of handling books, mainly liturgical, legal or choral practice, and in turn connects each practice to the horizontal or vertical behavioural patterns of users within a public or private environment. With her keen eye for observation in being able to identify various characteristics of inadvertent and targeted ware, the author adds a new dimension to the Medieval book. She gives the reader the opportunity to reflect on the social, anthropological and historical value of the use of the book by sharpening our senses to the way users handled books in different situations. Rudy has amassed an incredible amount of material for this research and the way in which she presents each manuscript conveys an approach that scholars on Medieval history and book materiality should keep in mind when carrying out their own research. What perhaps is most striking in her articulate text, is how she expresses that the touching of books was not without emotion, and the accumulated effects of these emotions are worthy of preservation, study and further reflection."--Publisher's website.  0aBooksxHistoryy400-1450. 0aManuscripts, MedievalxHistory and criticism. 0aCodicology. 0aBooksxHistoryy1450-1600. 0aMaterial culturexResearch.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.0 aSocial encounters with the book.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0337zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0337.jpgzConnect to cover image04645nam a2200589 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000260024702000250027303500220029804000210032004300120034110000380035324502800039125000210067126400470069226400110073930000680075033600260081833700330084433700260087733800360090350000440093950600480098353800360103154001660106750000650123350001180129850400550141650508980147152010440236960000310341365000420344465000420348665000410352865000510356965000510362065000660367165000660373765000160380370000490381971000380386885600570390685600920396399100747695970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         230509t20232023enka    sb    001 0beng d  z9781805110194 (hardback)  z9781805110187 (paperback)  a9781805110200q(pdf)  a9781805110248q(HTML)  a9781805110217q(epub)  a9781805110224q(AZW3)  a9781805110231q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1389612807  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk---1 aRobinson, Andrew,d1957-eauthor.14aThe last man who knew everythingh[electronic resource] :bThomas Young, the anonymous polymath who proved Newton wrong, explained how we see, cured the sick, and deciphered the Rosetta stone, among other feats of genius /cAndrew Robinson ; [with a foreword by Martin Rees].  aRevised edition. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xxx, 266 pages) :b17 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Celebrated biographer Andrew Robinson portrays a man who solved mystery after mystery in the face of ridicule and rejection, and never sought fame. As a physicist, Young challenged the theories of Isaac Newton and proved that light is a wave. As a physician, he showed how the eye focuses and proposed the three-colour theory of vision, only confirmed a century and a half later. As an Egyptologist, he made crucial contributions to deciphering the Rosetta Stone. It is hard to grasp how much Young knew. This biography is the fascinating story of a driven yet modest hero who cared less about what others thought of him than for the joys of an unbridled pursuit of knowledge-with a new foreword by Martin Rees and a new postscript discussing polymathy in the two centuries since the time of Young. It returns this neglected genius to his proper position in the pantheon of great scientific thinkers."--Publisher's website. 10aYoung, Thomas,d1773-1829. 0aScientistszGreat BritainvBiography. 0aPhysicianszGreat BritainvBiography. 0aLinguistszGreat BritainvBiography. 0aSciencezGreat BritainxHistoryy18th century. 0aSciencezGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century. 0aDiscoveries in sciencezGreat BritainxHistoryy18th century. 0aDiscoveries in sciencezGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century. 0aPhysicians.1 aRees, Martin J.,d1942-ewriter of foreword.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0344zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0344.jpgzConnect to cover image04376nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025504100130027610000460028924500980033526400470043326400110048030000410049133600260053233700260055833800360058449000670062050000440068750600480073153800360077954001660081550000700098150000920105150400530114354600410119650503270123752017900156465000440335465000460339865000600344465100340350471000750353871000380361383000560365185600570370785600940376499100752378970896620250313114123.0m     o  d        cr  n         230511t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805110682 (hbk.)  z9781805110675 (pbk.)  a9781805110699q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1385456036  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaheb1 aMartinez Delgado, José,d1974-eauthor.13aAn introduction to Andalusi Hebrew metricsh[electronic resource] /cJosé Martinez Delgado. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xviii, 194 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 18  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Strophic Poetry /     José Martínez Delgado.  a"Throughout the last two centuries, Hebrew metrics was studied by leading linguists and specialists in medieval Hebrew poetry. Nowadays, it has disappeared from the academic discussion such that it is sometimes even difficult to find scansions or the name of the meter in new editions of poems. This book aims to rectify this gap, helping readers to understand the metric structure of this poetry in order to facilitate the work of editing and cataloguing those samples still in manuscript form for future editors. Delgado presents his view of Andalusi Hebrew metrics, as encountered in medieval manuals of Arabic and Hebrew metrics and scattered notes in the works of Andalusi Hebrew philologists. Whilst twentieth-century scholars spoke about the adaptation of Arabic metrics to Hebrew, he instead approaches these compositions by Andalusi Jews (10th-13th c.) as Arabic metrics written in Hebrew, thus emphasising how Hebrew poetry of the Andalusi Jews can help us to understand the general evolution of Arabic strophic poetry, and its experimental evolution, which is quite unlike classical and strophic Arabic poetry. This method respects the Hebrew vowel system, and does not necessitate alteration of word morphology, leaving the guttural letters quiescent (unless required by metrical license); nor does it necessitate guesses about metres that are not in the classical catalogue. Although the author has not found each and every classical metre from Andalusi Hebrew poetry included in this manual, they are all catalogued, either in case someone finds them in future or because they help us to comprehend the metrical structures that are characteristic of strophic poetry. As such, this monograph will be of great interest to scholars of Hebrew metrics."--Publisher's website.  0aHebrew languagexMetrics and rhythmics. 0aHebrew literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aHebrew poetryzSpainzAndalusiaxHistory and criticism. 0aAndalusia (Spain)xLanguages.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 18.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0351zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0351.jpgzConnect to cover image  04712nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017003500220019504000210021704300120023824501400025026400470039026400110043730000420044833600260049033700260051633800360054250000440057850600480062253800360067054001660070650400530087250513220092552016270224765000340387465000480390865000380395665000400399470000280403470000290406271000380409185600570412985600920418699100752722970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         230515t20232023enk     sb    001 0beng d  z9781800649248 (hardback)  z9781800649231 (paperback)  a9781800649255q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1385453015  aStSaULbengerda  ae------00aMigrant academics' narratives of precarity and resilience in Europeh[electronic resource] /cedited by Olga Burlyuk and Ladan Rahbari. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xxxii, 248 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

The autobiographic and autoethnographic contributions to this collection aim to decolonise the discourse around academic mobility by highlighting experiences of precarity, resilience, care and solidarity in the academic margins. The authors use precarity to analyse the state of affairs in the academy, from hiring practices to 'culturally' accepted division of labour, systematic forms of discrimination, racialisation, and gendered hierarchies, etc. Building on precarity as a critical concept for challenging social exclusion or forming political collectives, the authors move away from conventional academic styles, instead adopting autobiography and autoethnography as methods of intersectional scholarly analysis. This approach creatively challenges the divisions between the system and the individual, the mind and the soul, the objective and the subjective, as well as science, theory, and art. This volume will be of interest not only to scholars within the field of migration studies, but also to instructors and students of sociology, postcolonial studies, gender and race studies, and critical border studies. The volume's interdisciplinary approach also seeks to address university diversity officers, managers, key decision-makers, and other readers directly or indirectly involved in contemporary academia. The format and style of its contributions are wide-ranging (including poetry and creative prose), thus making it accessible and readable for a general audience."--Publisher's website.  0aCollege teachersxEmployment. 0aEmigration and immigrationxSocial aspects. 0aForced migrationxSocial aspects. 0aDiscrimination in higher education.1 aBurlyuk, Olga,eeditor.1 aRahbari, Ladan,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0331zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0331.jpgzConnect to cover image07551nam a2200541 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000220019502000260021702000230024302000260026602000230029202200140031503500210032904000210035010000320037124500940040325000210049726400470051826400110056530000710057633600260064733700260067333800360069949000540073550000440078950600480083353800360088154001600091753601930107750001420127050400670141250536420147952014320512165000530655365000280660670000380663471000380667271000970671083000520680785600580685985600920691799100947403970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20122012enkab   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781906924713 (Hardback)  z9781906924706 (Paperback)  a9781906924720q(pdf)  a1906924724q(pdf)  a9781906924737q(epub)  a1906924732q(epub)  a9781906924744q(mobi)  a1906924740q(mobi)  a2054-362X  a(OCoLC)849917866  aStSaULbengerda1 aFinnegan, Ruth H.,eauthor.10aOral literature in Africah[electronic resource] /cRuth Finnegan ; foreword, Mark Turin.  aRevised edition. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2012] 4c©2012  a1 online resource (xliv, 570 pages) ;billustrations, colour maps.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aWorld oral literature seriesx2054-362X ;vvol. 1  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license (CC-BY 3.0).

It crosses boundaries of space and time, recurs in all human communities and finds expression in every aspect of cultural production - from pre-historic cave paintings to high-tech computer games. This book examines historical and imaginary scenarios of Apocalypse, the depiction of its likely triggers, and imagined landscapesin the aftermath of global destruction. Its discussion moves effortlessly from classic novels including Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake, to blockbuster films such as Blade Runner, Armageddon and The Terminator. The author also takes into account religious doctrine, scientific research and the visual arts to create a penetrating, multi-disciplinary study that provides profound insight into one of Western culture's darkest and most enduring preoccupations."--Publisher's website.  0aApocalypse in literature. 0aEnd of the world in literature. 0aApocalypse in motion pictures. 0aApocalypse in art. 0aApocalytpic literaturexHistory and criticism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0015zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0015.jpgzConnect to cover image04197nam a2200553 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031424500820033526400470041726400110046430000340047533600260050933700260053533800360056149000450059750000440064250600480068653800360073454002160077058800470098650400970103350000480113050507720117852009620195061000580291265000520297065000660302265000350308865000620312365000700318570000340325571000420328971000810333171000380341283000440345085600570349485600920355199100947411970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr cnu---unuuu120508t20112011enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781906924409 (Hardback)  z9781906924393 (Paperback)  a9781906924416q(pdf)  a9781906924485q(epub)  a9781906924492q(mobi)  z2399-6668 (Print)  a2399-6676 (Online)  a(OCoLC)794698072   aStSaULbengerda00aPeace and democratic societyh[electronic resource] /cedited by Amartya Sen. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2011] 4c©2011  a1 online resource (155 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen reports seriesx2399-6676 ;vvol. 1  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aPeace and Democratic Society is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial - No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England & Wales License.

In an insightful introductory essay to this report, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen challenges widely accepted explanations for violence. He makes a plea for a global, multilateral debate on the causes of conflict, and an understanding of the multiple identities of the individuals involved. The introductory essay draws on the findings of the Commonwealth Commission on Respect and Understanding, which was chaired by Sen, and established to promote mutual communication and understanding among all faiths and communities in the Commonwealth. Its timely report, "Civil Paths to Peace", suggests that governments, media and educators-indeed, everyone-must take the time to understand the complexities around violent behaviour and its causes, without prejudging what these might be."--Publisher's website.20aCommonwealth Commission on Respect and Understanding. 0aPeacexInternational cooperationy21st century. 0aConflict managementxInternational cooperationy21st century. 0aDemocratizationy21st century. 0aNation-buildingxInternational cooperationy21st century. 0aSecurity, InternationalxInternational cooperationy21st century.1 aSen, Amartya,d1933-eeditor.2 aCommonwealth Secretariat,epublisher.2 aCommonwealth Commission on Respect and Understanding.tCivil paths to peace.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen reports series ;vv. 1.x2399-667640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0014zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0014.jpgzConnect to cover image04904nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000220019503500220021704000210023924501360026026400470039626400110044330000580045433600260051233700260053833800360056450000440060050600480064453800360069254002270072858800470095550400670100250523570106952006810342660000600410765100270416770000280419470000310422270000300425371000380428385600570432185600920437899100947415970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr cnu---unuuu121120t20112011enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781906924379 (Hardback)  z9781906924362 (Paperback)  a9781906924386q(pdf)  a1906924384q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)794698071   aStSaULbengerda00aHenry James's Europeh[electronic resource] :bheritage and transfer /cedited by Dennis Tredy, Annick Duperray and Adrian Harding. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2011] 4c©2011  a1 online resource (xxiv, 292 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aHenry James's Europe: Heritage and Transfer is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England & Wales License.

The plight of bewildered Americans adrift on a sea of European sophistication became a regular theme in his fiction. This collection of twenty-four papers from some of the worlds leading James scholars offers a comprehensive picture of the authors cross-cultural aesthetics. It provides detailed analyses of James's perception of Europe -- of its people and places, its history and culture, its artists and thinkers, its aesthetics and its ethics -- which ultimately lead to a profound re-evaluation of his writing"--Publisher's website.10aJames, Henry,d1843-1916xCriticism and interpretation. 0aEuropexIn literature.1 aTredy, Dennis,eeditor.1 aDuperray, Annick,eeditor.1 aHarding, Adrian,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0013zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0013.jpgzConnect to cover image03570nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000260014002000300016602000280019602000250022402000220024903500220027104000210029310000310031424501020034526400470044726400110049430000390050533600260054433700260057033800360059650000440063250600480067653800360072454002410076050400680100150507010106952011080177065000150287865000250289365000310291871000380294985600570298785600920304499100947419970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20112011enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781906924348 (Hardback)  z1906924341 (Hardback)  z9781906924331 (Paperback)  z1906924333q(Paperback)  a9781906924355q(pdf)  a190692435Xq(pdf)  a(OCoLC)741648010   aStSaULbengerda1 aFinnegan, Ruth H.,eauthor10aWhy do we quote?h[electronic resource] :bthe culture and history of quotation /cRuth Finnegan. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2011] 4c©2011  a1 online resource (xvi, 327 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aWhy Do We Quote?

But do we really know what it means? How do people actually quote today, and how did our present systems come about? This book brings together a down-to-earth account of contemporary quoting with an examination of the comparative and historical background that lies behind it and the characteristic way that quoting links past and present, the far and the near.   Drawing from anthropology, cultural history, folklore, cultural studies, sociolinguistics, literary studies and the ethnography of speaking, Ruth Finnegan's fascinating study sets our present conventions into cross-cultural and historical perspective. She traces the curious history of quotation marks, examines the long tradition of quotation collections with their remarkable recycling across the centuries, and explores the uses of quotation in literary, visual and oral traditions. The book tracks the changing definitions and control of quoting over the millennia and in doing so throws new light on ideas such as 'imitation', 'allusion', 'authorship', 'originality' and 'plagiarism'."--Publisher's website. 0aQuotation. 0aQuotationsxHistory. 0aQuotationxSocial aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0012zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0012.jpgzConnect to cover image03997nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017003500210019504000210021610000360023724500750027326400470034826400110039530000570040633600260046333700260048933800360051550000440055150600480059553800360064354002100067950000680088950400670095750505440102452013670156860000850293560000470302060000590306760000600312660000480318660000620323465000560329671000380335285600570339085600920344799100947423970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         121009t20102010enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781906924317 (Hardback)  z9781906924300 (Paperback)  a9781906924324q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)847609650  aStSaULbengerda1 aMulhallen, Jacqueline,eauthor.04aThe theatre of Shelleyh[electronic resource] /cJacqueline Mulhallen. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2010] 4c©2010  a1 online resource (xvi, 289 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe Theatre of Shelley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial - No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England & Wales License.

It offers a rich, meticulously researched history of Shelley's role as a playwright and dramatist and a reassessment of his "closet dramas" as performable pieces of theatre. With chapters on each of Shelley's dramatic works, the book provides a thorough discussion of the poet's stagecraft, and analyses performances of his plays from the Georgian period to today. In addition, Mulhallen offers details of the productions Shelley saw in England and Italy, many not identified before, as well as a vivid account of the actors and personalities that constituted the theatrical scene of his time. Her research reveals Shelley as an extraordinarily talented playwright, whose fascination with contemporary theatrical theory and practice seriously challenges the notion that he was a reluctant dramatist.  Prof. Stephen Behrendt (Nebraska) has described the book as "wonderfully convincing" and "something wholly new in Shelley studies", while Prof. Tim Webb (Bristol) describes Mulhallen as having a "more precisely developed sense of the theatrical possibilities of Shelley's work than almost anybody who has written about Shelley". The Theatre of Shelley is essential reading for anyone interested in Romanticism, nineteenth-century culture and the history of theatre."--Publisher's website. 10aShelley, Percy Bysshe,d1792-1822xDramatic worksxCriticism and interpretation.10aShelley, Percy Bysshe,d1792-1822.tCenci.10aShelley, Percy Bysshe,d1792-1822.tCharles the First.10aShelley, Percy Bysshe,d1792-1822.tPrometheus unbound.10aShelley, Percy Bysshe,d1792-1822.tHellas.10aShelley, Percy Bysshe,d1792-1822.tSwellfoot the Tyrant. 0aEnglish dramay19th centuryxHistory and criticism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0011zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0011.jpgzConnect to cover image04441nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017003500210019504000210021604100130023710000490025024000300029924501490032926400470047826400110052530000470053633600260058333700260060933800360063550000440067150600480071553800360076354002300079950001090102950001290113850400720126750400400133950503720137952017210175154600320347260000400350465000480354465100460359265100540363870000680369271000380376085600570379885600920385599100947427970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20102010enkc    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781906924287 (Hardback)  z9781906924270 (Paperback)  a9781906924294q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)798294479  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghger1 aZur Mühlen, Hermynia,d1883-1951,eauthor.10aEnde und Anfang.lEnglish14aThe end and the beginningh[electronic resource] :bthe book of my life /cby Hermynia Zur Mühlen; with notes and a tribute by Lionel Gossman. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2010] 4c©2010  a1 online resource (295 pages) :bportrait.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe End and the Beginning: The Book of My Life is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England & Wales License.

Remembering Hermynia Zur Mühlen:  A Tribute / Lionel Gossman -- List of works by Hermynia Zur Mühlen in English translation.   a"First published in Germany in 1929, The End and the Beginning is a lively memoir of a vanished world and of a rebellious young woman's struggle to achieve independence. Born in 1883 into a distinguished and wealthy aristocratic family of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hermynia Zur Mühlen spent much of her childhood traveling in Europe and North Africa with her diplomat father. After five years on her German husband's estate in czarist Russia she broke with both her family and her husband and set out on a precarious career as a professional writer committed to socialism. As well as translating many leading contemporary authors, notably Upton Sinclair, into German, she herself published an impressive number of politically engaged novels, detective stories, short stories, and children's fairy tales. Because of her outspoken opposition to National Socialism, she had to flee her native Austria in 1938 and seek refuge in England, where she died, virtually penniless, in 1951. This revised and corrected translation of Zur Mühlen's memoir-with extensive notes and an essay on the author by Lionel Gossman-will appeal especially to readers interested in women's history, World War I, and the culture and politics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Seven free online supplements are also provided, containing additional original material including a selection of newly translated stories by Zur Mühlen, biographical essays by Gossman and a portfolio of images. The Federal Ministry of Education, Art, and Culture, Department of Literature (/BMUKK-Kultur; Literaturabteilung/), Vienna, Austria, has generously contributed towards the publication of this volume."--Publisher's website.  aTranslated from the German.10aZur Mühlen, Hermynia,d1883-1951. 0aAuthors, Austriany20th centuryvBiography. 0aAustriaxSocial conditionsy19th century. 0aEurope, CentralxSocial conditionsy20th century.1 aGossman, Lionel,etranslator,eeditor,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0010zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0010.jpgzConnect to cover image04789nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017003500220019504000210021710000300023824501440026826400470041226400110045930000670047033600260053733700260056333800360058950000440062550600480066953800360071754002430075350400700099650520320106652008420309865000440394065000350398465000450401965000350406470000360409970000330413571000380416885600570420685600920426399100947431970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20102010enkag   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781906924164 (Hardback)  z9781906924157 (Paperback)  a9781906924171q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1135558565  aStSaULbengerda1 aBrine, Kevin R.,eauthor.14aThe sword of Judithh[electronic resource] :bJudith studies across the disciplines /cKevin R.

The story has fascinated artists and authors for centuries, and is becoming a major field of research in its own right. The Sword of Judith is the first multidisciplinary collection of essays to discuss representations of Judith throughout the centuries. Bringing together scholars from around the world, it transforms our understanding of Judith's enduring story across a wide range of disciplines. The book includes sections on Judith in Christian, Jewish and secular textual traditions, as well as representations of Judith in art, music and theatre. The collection includes new archival source studies and the translation of unpublished manuscripts and texts previously unavailable in English.  0aJudith (Jewish heroine)xIn literature. 0aJudith (Jewish heroine)xArt.  0aJudith (Biblical figure)xIn literature. 0aJudith (Biblical figure)xArt.1 aCiletti, Elena,d1948-eauthor.1 aLahnemann, Henrike,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0009zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0009.jpgzConnect to cover image03657nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002200220019502200230021703500220024004000210026224501690028326400470045226400110049930000560051033600260056633700260059233800360061849000530065450000440070750600480075153800360079954002950083550400410113050506970117152009470186865000280281565000270284365000310287065000320290165000290293371000380296283000500300085600570305085600920310799100947435970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20102010enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781906924256 (Hardback)  z9781906924249 (Paperback)  a9781906924263q(pdf)  z2054-2410 (Print)  z2054-2429 (Online)  a(OCoLC)794698069   aStSaULbengerda00aText and genre in reconstructionh[electronic resource] :beffects of digitalization on Ideas, behaviours, products and institutions /c[edited by] Willard McCarty. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2010] 4c©2010  a1 online resource (x, 243 pages) :billustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 a[Digital humanities seriesx2054-2429 ;vvol. 1]  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText and Genre in Reconstruction: Effects of Digitalization on Ideas, Behaviours, Products and Institutions is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial - No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England & Wales License.

In doing so, it challenges the very notion of scholarship as it has traditionally been imagined. Incorporating scientific, socio-historical, materialist and theoretical approaches, this rich body of work explores topics ranging from how computers have affected our relationship to language, whether the book has become an obsolete object, the nature of online journalism, and the psychology of authorship. The essays offer a significant contribution to the growing debate on how digitization is shaping our collective identity, for better or worse. Text and Genre in Reconstruction will appeal to scholars in both the humanities and sciences and provides essential reading for anyone interested in the changing relationship between reader and text in the digital age."--Publisher's website. 0aDigital communications. 0aWritten communication. 0aCommunication and culture. 0aComputers and civilization. 0aElectronic publications.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aDigital humanities series ;vv. 1.x2054-242940uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0008zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0008.jpgzConnect to cover image04866nam a2200409 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017003500210019504000210021624501530023726400470039026400110043730000570044833600260050533700260053133800360055750000440059350600480063753800360068554001940072150400530091550516910096852014570265965000250411665000300414170000290417170000330420070000360423371000380426985600570430785600920436499100947439970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20102010enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781906924195 (Hardback)  z9781906924188 (Paperback)  a9781906924201q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)973231258  aStSaULbengerda00aPrivilege and propertyh[electronic resource] :bessays on the history of copyright /cedited by Ronan Deazley, Martin Kretschmer and Lionel Bently. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2010] 4c©2010  a1 online resource (xii, 438 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aSome rights are reserved.

The act of copying, and the creation and transaction of rights relating to it, evokes fundamental notions of communication and censorship, of authorship and ownership-of privilege and property. This volume conceives a new history of copyright law that has its roots in a wide range of norms and practices. The essays reach back to the very material world of craftsmanship and mechanical inventions of Renaissance Italy where, in 1469, the German master printer Johannes of Speyer obtained a five-year exclusive privilege to print in Venice and its dominions. Along the intellectual journey that follows, we encounter John Milton who, in 1644 accused the English parliament of having been deceived by the 'fraud of some old patentees and monopolizers in the trade of bookselling' (i.e. the London Stationers' Company). Later revisionary essays investigate the regulation of the printing press in the North American colonies as a provincial and somewhat crude version of European precedents, and how, in the revolutionary France of 1789, the subtle balance that the royal decrees had established between the interests of the author, the bookseller, and the public, was shattered by the abolition of the privilege system. Some of the essays also address the specific evolution of rights associated with the visual and performing arts."--Publisher's website. 0aCopyrightxHistory.  0aCopyright, International.1 aDeazley, Ronan,eeditor.1 aKretschmer, Martin,eeditor.1 aBently, Lionel,d1964-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0007zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0007.jpgzConnect to cover image04478nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000260014002000300016602000270019602000250022302000220024803500210027004000210029110000270031224501840033926400470052326400110057030000600058133600260064133700260066733800360069350000440072950600480077353800360082154002310085758800470108850400670113550504740120252018950167660000620357165000360363365000250366970000280369470000490372270000380377171000380380985600570384785600920390499100947443970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20102010enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781906924133 (Hardback)  z1906924139 (Hardback)  z9781906924126 (Paperback)  z1906924120 (Paperback)  a9781906924140q(pdf)  a1906924147q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)794049527  aStSaULbengerda1 aHough, Barry,eauthor.10aColeridge's lawsh[electronic resource] :ba study of Coleridge in Malta /cBarry Hough and Howard Davis ; with an introduction by Michael John Kooy ; translations by Lydia Davis. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2010] 4c©2010  a1 online resource (xxviii, 375 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aColeridge's Laws: A Study of Coleridge in Malta is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England & Wales License.

This was a formative experience for Coleridge which he later identified as being one of the most instructive in his entire life. In this book, Barry Hough and Howard Davis show how Coleridge's actions whilst in a position of power differ markedly from the idealism he had advocated before taking office - shedding new light on Coleridge's sense of political and legal morality. Meticulously researched and including newly discovered archival materials, Coleridge's Laws provides detailed analysis of the laws and public notices drafted by Coleridge, together with the first published translations of them. Drawing from a wealth of primary sources, Hough and Davis identify the political challenges facing Coleridge and reveal that, in attempting to win over the Maltese public to support Britain's strategic interests, Coleridge was complicit in acts of government which were both inconsistent with the rule of law and contrary to his professed beliefs. Coleridge's willingness to overlook accepted legal processes and personal misgivings for political expediency is disturbing and, as explained by Michael John Kooy in his extensive introduction, necessarily alters our understanding of the author and his writing. Coleridge's Laws contributes in new ways to the current debates about Coleridge's achievements, British colonialism and its engagement with the rule of law, nationhood and the effectiveness of the British administration of Malta. It provides essential reading for anybody interested in Coleridge specifically and the Romantics more generally, for political and legal historians and for students of colonial government."--Publisher's website.10aColeridge, Samuel Taylor,d1772-1834xPolitical activity. 0aColonial administratorszMalta. 0aLawzMaltaxHistory.1 aDavis, Howard,eauthor.1 aKooy, Michael John,ewriter of introduction.1 aDavis, Lydia,d1947-etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0005zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0005.jpgzConnect to cover image03657nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017003500210019504000210021610000300023724501230026726400470039026400110043730000560044833600260050433700260053033800360055650000440059250600480063653800360068454002580072050400530097850509980103152007310202965000550276065000590281565000400287465000460291465000430296065000330300371000380303685600570307485600920313199100947447970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20092009enka    s     000 0 eng d  z9781906924102 (Hardback)  z9781906924096 (Paperback)  a9781906924119q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)849917878  aStSaULbengerda1 aBlamires, David,eauthor.00aTelling talesh[electronic resource] :bthe impact of Germany on English children's books 1780-1918 /cDavid Blamires. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2009] 4c©2009  a1 online resource (xi, 459 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aTelling Tales: The Impact of Germany on English Children's Books 1780-1918 is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England & Wales License.

The Brothers Grimm, The Swiss Family Robinson and Johanna Spyri's Heidi quickly became classics but, as David Blamires clearly articulates in this volume, many other works have been fundamental in the development of English children's stories during the 19th century and beyond. Telling Tales is the first comprehensive study of the impact of Germany on English children's books, covering the period from 1780 to the First World War.

Heinrich Vogeler was a well-regarded artist who was to join the German Communist Party. Ludwig Roselius was a successful businessman who had made a fortune from his invention of decaffeinated coffee. What was it about the revolutionary climate following World War I that induced three such different personalities to collaborate in the production of a slim volume of poetry-entitled Gott in Mir-about the indwelling of the divine within the human? Gossman's study situates the poem in the ideological context that made the collaboration possible: pantheism, Darwinism, disillusionment with traditional liberal values, theosophy and völkisch religions, and Lebensreform. The study outlines the subsequent life of the Princess who, until her death in 1993, continued to support and celebrate the ideals and heroes of National Socialism. Brownshirt Princess provides deep insight into the sources and character of the "Nazi Conscience", and is invaluable reading for anybody interested in understanding German society during the inter-war and Nazi periods.

Combining historical, political, and textual analysis, Kolker develops a pattern of cinematic invention and experimentation from neorealism through the modernist interventions of Jean-Luc Godard and Rainer Maria Fassbinder, focusing along the way on such major figures as Luis Buñuel, Joseph Losey, the Brazilian director Glauber Rocha, and the work of major Cuban filmmakers.    Kolker's book has become a much quoted classic in the field of film studies providing essential reading for anybody interested in understanding the history of European and international cinema.

This particular passage is from the second book of Cicero's Speeches against Verres, who was a former Roman magistrate on trial for serious misconduct. Cicero presents the lurid details of Verres' alleged crimes in exquisite and sophisticated prose. This volume provides a portion of the original text of Cicero's speech in Latin, a detailed commentary, study aids, and a translation. As a literary artefact, the speech gives us insight into how the supreme master of Latin eloquence developed what we would now call rhetorical "spin". As an historical document, it provides a window into the dark underbelly of Rome's imperial expansion and exploitation of the Near East. Ingo Gildenhard's illuminating commentary on this A-Level set text will be of particular interest to students of Latin at both high school and undergraduate level. It will also be a valuable resource to Latin teachers and to anyone interested in Cicero, language and rhetoric, and the legal culture of Ancient Rome."--Publisher's website.  aTranslated from the Latin.10aVerres, Gaius,d1st cent.

Texts, audio, pictures and video can easily be produced, disseminated, used and remixed using devices that are increasingly user-friendly and affordable. However, along with this technological democratization comes a paradoxical flipside: the norms regulating culture's use-copyright and related rights-have become increasingly restrictive. This book brings together essays by academics, librarians, entrepreneurs, activists and policy makers, who were all part of the EU-funded Communia project. Together the authors argue that the Public Domain-that is, the informational works owned by all of us, be that literature, music, the output of scientific research, educational material or public sector information-is fundamental to a healthy society. The essays range from more theoretical papers on the history of copyright and the Public Domain, to practical examples and case studies of recent projects that have engaged with the principles of Open Access and Creative Commons licensing. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in the current debate about copyright and the Internet. It opens up discussion and offers practical solutions to the difficult question of the regulation of culture at the digital age."--Publisher's website. 0aCopyright and electronic data processing. 0aPublic domain (Copyright law). 0aPublic domain (Copyright law)zEurope.  0aInternetxLaw and legislation. 0aFair use (Copyright) 0aIntellectual property.1 aDulong de Rosnay, Mélanie,eeditor.1 aDe Martin, Juan Carlos,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aDigital humanities series ;vv. 2.x2054-242940uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0019zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0019.jpgzConnect to cover image03881nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026810000340028924500720032326400470039526400110044230000340045333600260048733700260051333800360053950000440057550600480061953800360066754001600070350400670086350511590093052010140208960000640310360000770316765000280324471000380327285600570331085600920336799100947544970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20112011enk     s     000 0 eng d  z9781906924430 (Hardback)  z9781906924423 (Paperback)  a9781906924447q(pdf)  a9781783740055q(epub)  a9781783740062q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)794698073  aStSaULbengerda1 aSpeller, John R.

It provides a comprehensive overview and critical assessment of his contributions to literary theory and his thinking about authors and literary works.    One of the foremost French intellectuals of the post-war era, Bourdieu has become a standard point of reference in the fields of anthropology, linguistics, art history, cultural studies, politics, and sociology, but his longstanding interest in literature has often been overlooked. This study explores the impact of literature on Bourdieu's intellectual itinerary, and how his literary understanding intersected with his sociological theory and thinking about cultural policy.   This is the first full-length study of Bourdieu's work on literature in English, and it provides an invaluable resource for students and scholars of literary studies, cultural theory and sociology."--Publisher's website.10aBourdieu, Pierre,d1930-2002xCriticism and interpretation.10aBourdieu, Pierre,d1930-2002xContributions in philosophy of literature. 0aLiteraturexPhilosophy.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0027zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0027.jpgzConnect to cover image04902nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026824501900028926400470047926400110052630000610053733600260059833700260062433800360065050000440068650600480073053800360077854001470081450400670096150512530102852014870228153001170376865100380388565100410392365100380396465100400400265100410404265100400408370000300412370000350415370000330418871000380422185600570425985600920431699100947548970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20122012enkab   sb d    1   eng d  z9781906924881 (Hardback)  z9781906924874 (Paperback)  a9781906924898z(pdf)  a9781906924904z(epub)  a9781906924911z(mobi)  a(OCoLC)847783502  aStSaULbengerda00aFrontier encountersh[electronic resource] :bknowledge and practice at the Russian, Chinese and Mongolian border /cedited by Franck Billé, Grégory Delaplace and Caroline Humphrey. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2012] 4c©2012  a1 online resource (x, 281 pages) :billustrations, maps.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.For more detailed information consult the publisher's website.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 249-270) and index.0 a1.

Yet, despite their proximity, their practical, local interactions with each other - and with their third neighbour  Mongolia - are rarely discussed. The three countries share a boundary, but their traditions, languages and worldviews are remarkably different.   Frontier Encounters presents a wide range of views on how the borders between these unique countries are enacted, produced, and crossed. It sheds light on global uncertainties: China's search for energy resources and the employment of its huge population, Russia's fear of Chinese migration, and the precarious economic independence of Mongolia as its neighbours negotiate to extract its plentiful resources.  Bringing together anthropologists, sociologists and economists, this timely collection of essays offers new perspectives on an area that is currently of enormous economic, strategic and geo-political relevance.    This collective volume is the outcome of a network project funded by the ESRC (RES-075-25_0022) entitled "Where Empires Meet: The Border Economies of Russia, China and Mongolia". The project, based at the Mongolia and Inner Asia Studies Unit (University of Cambridge), ran from 28 January 2010 to 27 January 2011. That project formed the foundation for a new and ongoing research project "The life of borders: where China and Russia meet" which commenced in October 2012."--Publisher's website.   aMore information about both projects and Frontier Encounters is available via a link on the publisher's website. 0aRussiaxForeign relationszChina. 0aRussiaxForeign relationszMongolia. 0aChinaxForeign relationszRussia. 0aChinaxForeign relationszMongolia. 0aMongoliaxForeign relationszRussia. 0aMongoliaxForeign relationszChina.1 aBillé, Franck,eeditor.1 aDelaplace, Grégory,eeditor.1 aHumphrey, Caroline,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0026zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0026.jpgzConnect to cover image03198nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026810000310028924501200032024600370044026400470047726400110052430000560053533600260059133700260061733800360064350000440067950600480072353800360077154001850080750400670099250503590105952010280141865000380244665000280248465000280251271000250254071000380256585600570260385600920266099100947550970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20122012enka    sb d    1   eng d  z9781906924935 (Hardback)  z9781906924928 (Paperback)  a9781906924942q(pdf)  a9781906924959q(epub)  a9781906924966q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)849917882  aStSaULbengerda1 aLevine, David K.,eauthor.10aIs behavioral economics doomed?h[electronic resource] :bthe ordinary versus the extraordinary /cDavid K.

All of us facing the global economic crisis wonder just how rational economic men and women can be. Behavioral economics - an effort to incorporate psychological ideas into economics - has become all the rage.This book by well-known economist David K. Levine questions the idea that behavioral economics is the answer to economic problems. It explores the successes and failures of contemporary economics both inside and outside the laboratory. It then asks whether popular behavioral theories of psychological biases are solutions to the failures. It not only provides an overview of popular behavioral theories and their history, but also gives the reader the tools for scrutinizing them. Levine's book is essential reading for students and teachers of economic theory and anyone interested in the psychology of economics."--Publisher's website. 0aEconomicsxPsychological aspects. 0aRational choice theory. 0aConsumers' preferences.2 aMax Weber Programme.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0021zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0021.jpgzConnect to cover image02996nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000300011102000270014102000250016802000260019302000260021903500210024504000210026610000320028724500640031926400470038326400110043030000520044133600260049333700260051933800360054550000440058150600480062553800360067354002050070950400410091450502440095552011190119965000150231865000370233365000170237071000380238785600570242585600920248299100947554970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr            120925t20122012enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781906924775 (Paperback)  z1906924775 (Paperback)  a9781906924799q(pdf)  a9781906924805q(epub)  a9781906924812q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)839686284  aStSaULbengerda1 aRubinstein, Ariel,eauthor.10aEconomic fablesh[electronic resource] /cAriel Rubinstein. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2012] 4c©2012  a1 online resource (255 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aSome rights are reserved.

Together with an introduction to some of the central concepts in modern economic thought, Ariel Rubinstein offers some powerful and entertaining reflections on his childhood, family and career. In doing so, he challenges many of the central tenets of game theory, and sheds light on the role economics can play in society at large. The book is as thought-provoking for seasoned economists as it is enlightening for newcomers to the field. Sylvia Nasar, author of A Beautiful Mind, describes Economics Fables as a "wonderfully inviting introduction to game theory, rich in personalities, history and sense of place. Ariel Rubinstein is not only a brilliant theorist with a knack for lucid exposition, but a gifted storyteller. Students will find the ideas surprisingly accessible. Aspiring scholars, wondering whether a life of the mind is worth pursuing, will find his personal journey of intellectual discovery thrilling."--Publisher's website. 0aEconomics. 0aEconomicsxSociological aspects. 0aGame theory.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0020zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0020.jpgzConnect to cover image02585nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026824501310028926400470042026400110046730000560047833600260053433700260056033800360058650000440062250600480066653800360071454002280075050400510097850507010102965000420173065000520177265100370182465100420186170000290190370000310193271000380196385600580200185600920205999100947558970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20122012enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781906924669 (Hardback)  z9781906924652 (Paperback)  a9781906924676q(pdf)  a9781906924683q(epub)  a9781906924690q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)785989178  aStSaULbengerda00aWomen in nineteenth-century Russiah[electronic resource] :blives and culture /cedited by Wendy Rosslyn and Alessandra Tosi. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2012] 4c©2012  a1 online resource (ix, 249 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aSome rights are reserved.

It was Printz-Påhlson who introduced poetic modernism to Scandinavia, and his essays and poems delve deeply into English, American, and continental modernist traditions.    As well as Letters of Blood, the collection includes the full text of The Words of the Tribe, a major statement on modern poetics, in which Printz-Påhlson explores the significance of primitivism in Romanticism and Modernism, and the nature of metaphor and literary materialism. The collection also includes essays on style, irony, realism, and the relationship between historical drama and historical fiction, as well as studies of American poetry. Printz-Påhlson's poetry in English continues to explore these themes by different, often surprisingly innovative, means."--Publisher's website. 0aSwedish poetryy20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aPoetry, Moderny20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aModernism (Literature)zSweden.1 aArchambeau, Robert,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0017zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0017.jpgzConnect to cover image04208nam a2200373 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017003500210019504000210021624501170023726400470035426400110040130000520041233600260046433700260049033800360051650000440055250600480059653800360064454002340068050400530091450516780096752009150264560000470356070000400360771000380364785600570368585600920374299100947577970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         121120t20102010enka    sb    001 0 fre d  z9781906924218 (Hardback)  z9781906924225 (Paperback)  a9781906924232q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)823770992  aStSaULbengerda04aLes bienveillantes de Jonathan Littellh[electronic resource] /cétudes réunis par Murielle Lucie Clément. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2010] 4c©2010  a1 online resource (344 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aLes Bienveillantes de Jonathan Littell, edited is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial - No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England & Wales License.

Described as "deliberately repellent" by The New York Times, Jonathan Littell's novel tells the story of World War II through the eyes of former SS officer Maximilien Aue. This is the first academic study of this controversial, best-selling work.   Twenty-one leading scholars discuss the aesthetics, themes and characters of the novel, as well as formal aspects of Littell's writing. They tackle ideas surrounding parricide, genocide, anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, as well as Littell's portrayal of both historical and fictional characters. The collection offers a deeply varied range of approaches to Littell's work and is essential reading for anyone interested in representations of World War II, the Holocaust and contemporary French literature.  All the essays in this collection are written in French."--Publisher's website.10aLittell, Jonathan,d1967-tBienveillantes.1 aClément, Murielle Lucie,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0006zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0006.jpgzConnect to cover image05213nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000270019502000260022203500220024804000210027024500770029126400470036826400110041530000570042633600260048333700260050933800360053550000440057150600480061553800360066354002240069950400490092350522020097252011260317465000590430065100530435965100260441265100310443865100580446970000530452771000380458085600570461885600920467599100950353970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         121130t20122012enka    sb    001   eng    z9781909254114 (Hardback)  z9781909254107 (Paperback)  a9781909254121q(pdf)  a9781909254138q(epubi)  a9781909254145q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1135600539  aStSaULbengerda02aA people passing rudeh[electronic resource] /cedited by Anthony Cross. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2012] 4c©2012  a1 online resource (xvi, 331 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aSome rights are reserved.

The essays in this stimulating collection attest to the scope and variety of Russia's influence on British culture. They move from the early nineteenth century-when Byron sent his hero Don Juan to meet Catherine the Great, and an English critic sought to come to terms with the challenge of Pushkin-to a series of Russian-themed exhibitions at venues including the Crystal Palace and Earls Court. The collection looks at British encounters with Russian music, the absorption with Dostoevskii and Chekhov, and finishes by shedding light on Britain's engagement with Soviet film. Edited by Anthony Cross, one of the world's foremost authorities on Anglo-Russian relations, A People Passing Rude is essential reading for anyone with an interest in British and Russian cultures and their complex relationship."--Publisher's website.  0aArt and literaturezGreat BritainxRussian influences. 0aGreat BritainxCivilizationxRussian influences. 0aRussiaxCivilization. 0aRussiaxIntellectual life. 0aGreat BritainxIntellectual lifexRussian influences.1 aCross, Anthonyq(Anthony Glenn),d1936-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0022zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0022.jpgzConnect to cover image03614nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031304100130033410000210034724000310036824501400039924600200053926400470055926400110060630000340061733600260065133700260067733800360070349000440073950000440078350600480082753800360087554001620091150400430107350502300111652012680134654600250261460000310263965000480267065000470271870000890276571000380285483000430289285600570293585600920299299100950367970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         121130t20122012enk     sb    000   eng d  z9781909254169 (Hardback)  z9781909254152 (Paperback)  a9781909254176q(pdf)  a9781909254183q(epub)  a9781909254190q(mobi)  z2054-2437 (Print)  a2054-2445 (Online)  a(OCoLC)823771303  aStSaULbengerda0 aengalat0 aVirgil,eauthor.10aAeneis.nLiber 4.lEnglish10aVirgil, Aeneid, 4.1-299h[electronic resource] :bLatin text, study questions, commentary and interpretative essays /cIngo Gildenhard.30aAeneid, 4.1-299 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2012] 4c©2012  a1 online resource (320 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aClassics textbooksx2054-2445 ;vvol. 2  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 unported license.

Bibliography.   a"Love and tragedy dominate book four of Virgil's most powerful work, building on the violent emotions invoked by the storms, battles, warring gods, and monster-plagued wanderings of the epic's opening. Destined to be the founder of Roman culture, Aeneas, nudged by the gods, decides to leave his beloved Dido, causing her suicide in pursuit of his historical destiny. A dark plot, in which erotic passion culminates in sex, and sex leads to tragedy and death in the human realm, unfolds within the larger horizon of a supernatural sphere, dominated by power-conscious divinities. Dido is Aeneas' most significant other, and in their encounter Virgil explores timeless themes of love and loyalty, fate and fortune, the justice of the gods, imperial ambition and its victims, and ethnic differences. This course book offers a portion of the original Latin text, study questions, a commentary, and interpretative essays. Designed to stretch and stimulate readers, Ingo Gildenhard's incisive commentary will be of particular interest to students of Latin at both A2 and undergraduate level. It extends beyond detailed linguistic analysis to encourage critical engagement with Virgil's poetry and discussion of the most recent scholarly thought."--Publisher's website.  aIncludes Latin text.00aVirgil.tAeneis.nLiber 4. 0aAeneas (Legendary character) in literature. 0aEpic poetry, LatinxHistory and criticism.1 aGildenhard, Ingo,d1970-ewriter of commentary,ewriter of supplementary material.  2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aClassics textbooks ;vv. 2.x2054-244540uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0023zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0023.jpgzConnect to cover image05388nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028524502200030626400470052626400110057330000540058433600260063833700260066433800360069050000440072650600480077053800360081854001720085450001250102650400820115150516810123352013480291461000720426265000310433465000450436565000650441065000580447565000650453370000340459870000320463270000310466471000380469585600570473385600920479099101257078970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         200114t20192019enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783747924 (hbk.)  z9781783747917 (pbk.)  a9781783747931q(pdf)  a9781783747948q(epub)  a9781783747955q(mobi)  a9781783747962q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1229185429  aStSaULbengerda04aThe DARPA model for transformative technologiesh[electronic resource] :bperspectives on the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency /cedited by William B.

Other parts of the U.S. Government and some foreign governments have tried to apply the 'DARPA model' to help develop valuable new technologies. But how and why has DARPA succeeded? Which features of its operation and environment contribute to this success? And what lessons does its experience offer for other U.S. agencies and other governments that want to develop and demonstrate their own 'transformative technologies'? This book is a remarkable collection of leading academic research on DARPA from a wide range of perspectives, combining to chart an important story from the Agency's founding in the wake of Sputnik, to the current attempts to adapt it to use by other federal agencies. Informative and insightful, this guide is essential reading for political and policy leaders, as well as researchers and students interested in understanding the success of this agency and the lessons it offers to others."--Publisher's website. 20aUnited States.bDefense Advanced Research Projects AgencyxHistory. 0aTechnological innovations. 0aTechnological innovationsvCase studies. 0aTechnological innovationsxGovernment policyzUnited States. 0aIndustriesxTechnological innovationszUnited States. 0aMilitary researchxTechnological innovationszUnited States.1 aBonvillian, William,eeditor.1 aVan Atta, Richard,eeditor.1 aWindham, Patrick,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0184zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0184.jpgzConnect to cover image04827nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000360030624501170034226400470045926400110050630000610051733600260057833700260060433800360063050000440066650600480071053800360075854001650079450400670095950510900102652019310211663000130404765000230406065000260408365000490410965000240415871000380418285600570422085600920427799101257826970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         200117t20202020enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783748280 (hbk.)  z9781783748273 (pbk.)  a9781783748297q(pdf)  a9781783748303q(epub)  a9781783748310q(mobi)  a9781783748327q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1137742465  aStSaULbengerda1 aPettit, Edward,d1968-eauthor.14aThe waning swordh[electronic resource] :bconversion imagery and celestial myth in Beowulf /cby Edward Pettit. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (562 pages) :b7 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This meticulously researched book investigates the nature and significance of this golden-hilted weapon and its likely relatives within Beowulf and beyond, drawing on the fields of Old English and Old Norse language and literature, liturgy, archaeology, astronomy, folklore and comparative mythology. In Part I, Pettit explores the complex of connotations surrounding this image (from icicles to candles and crosses) by examining a range of medieval sources, and argues that the giant sword may function as a visual motif in which pre-Christian Germanic concepts and prominent Christian symbols coalesce. In Part II, Pettit investigates the broader Germanic background to this image, especially in relation to the god Ing/Yngvi-Freyr, and explores the capacity of myths to recur and endure across time. Drawing on an eclectic range of narrative and linguistic evidence from Northern European texts, and on archaeological discoveries, Pettit suggests that the image of the giant sword, and the characters and events associated with it, may reflect an elemental struggle between the sun and the moon, articulated through an underlying myth about the theft and repossession of sunlight. The Waning Sword: Conversion Imagery and Celestial Myth in 'Beowulf' is a welcome contribution to the overlapping fields of Beowulf-scholarship, Old Norse-Icelandic literature and Germanic philology. Not only does it present a wealth of new readings that shed light on the craft of the Beowulf-poet and inform our understanding of the poem's major episodes and themes; it further highlights the merits of adopting an interdisciplinary approach alongside a comparative vantage point. As such, The Waning Sword will be compelling reading for Beowulf-scholars and for a wider audience of medievalists."--Publisher's website. 00aBeowulf. 0aSwordsxMythology. 0aSwords in literature. 0aOld Norse literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aGermanic philology.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0190zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0190.jpgzConnect to cover image04349nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026824501160028926400470040526400110045230000630046333600260052633700260055233800360057850000440061450600480065853800360070654001650074250400410090750511750094852014510212365000350357465000500360965000400365970000410369971000380374085600570377885600920383599101277567970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         141030t20142014enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783740680 (Hardback)  z9781783740673 (Paperback)  a9781783740697q(pdf)  a9781783740703q(epub)  a9781783740710q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)894506962  aStSaULbengerda00aCultural heritage ethicsh[electronic resource] :bbetween theory and practice /cedited by Constantine Sandis. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (xx, 208 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

The sentiment could not be truer of cultural heritage ethics. This intra-disciplinary book bridges the gap between theory and practice by bringing together a stellar cast of academics, activists, consultants, journalists, lawyers, and museum practitioners, each contributing their own expertise to the wider debate of what cultural heritage means in the twenty-first century.  Cultural Heritage Ethics provides cutting-edge arguments built on case studies of cultural heritage and its management in a range of geographical and cultural contexts. Moreover, the volume feels the pulse of the debate on heritage ethics by discussing timely issues such as access, acquisition, archaeological practice, curatorship, education, ethnology, historiography, integrity, legislation, memory, museum management, ownership, preservation, protection, public trust, restitution, human rights, stewardship, and tourism. This volume is neither a textbook nor a manifesto for any particular approach to heritage ethics, but a snapshot of different positions and approaches that will inspire both thought and action. Cultural Heritage Ethics provides invaluable reading for students and teachers of philosophy of archaeology, history and moral philosophy - and for anyone interested in the theory and practice of cultural preservation."--Publisher's website. 0aCultural propertyxManagement. 0aCultural propertyxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aMuseumsxMoral and ethical aspects.1 aSandis, Constantine,d1976-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0047.jpgzConnect to cover image05956nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026910000270029024501160031726400470043326400110048030000550049133600260054633700260057233800360059850000440063450600480067853800360072654001770076250400670093950522720100652019930327865000320527165000230530365000210532671000380534785600570538585600920544299101277579970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         141030t20142014enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783740734 (Hardback)  z9781783740727 (Paperback)  a9781783740741q(pdf)  a9781783740758q(epub)  a9781783740765q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1076724528  aStSaULbengerda1 aBlumson, Ben,eauthor.00aResemblance and representationh[electronic resource] :ban essay in the philosophy of pictures /cBen Blumson. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (x, 212 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

The most important difference between my portrait and my name, for example, is that whereas my portrait and I are connected by my portrait's resemblance to me, my name and I are connected merely by an arbitrary convention. The first aim of this book is to defend this platitude from the apparently compelling objections raised against it, by analysing depiction in a way which reveals how it is mediated by resemblance.  It's natural to contrast the platitude that depiction is mediated by resemblance, which emphasises the differences between depictive and descriptive representation, with an extremely close analogy between depiction and description, which emphasises the similarities between depictive and descriptive representation. Whereas the platitude emphasises that the connection between my portrait and me is natural in a way the connection between my name and me is not, the analogy emphasises the contingency of the connection between my portrait and me. Nevertheless, the second aim of this book is to defend an extremely close analogy between depiction and description. The strategy of the book is to argue that the apparently compelling objections raised against the platitude that depiction is mediated by resemblance are manifestations of more general problems, which are familiar from the philosophy of language. These problems, it argues, can be resolved by answers analogous to their counterparts in the philosophy of language, without rejecting the platitude. So the combination of the platitude that depiction is mediated by resemblance with a close analogy between depiction and description turns out to be a compelling theory of depiction, which combines the virtues of common sense with the insights of its detractors."--Publisher's website. 0aRepresentation (Philosophy) 0aImage (Philosophy) 0aArtxPhilosophy.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0046zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0046.jpgzConnect to cover image04331nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026904100130029010000410030324000300034424503030037424600200067726400470069726400110074430000710075533600260082633700260085233800360087850000440091450600480095853800360100654001790104250400410122150501270126252015380138953002620292754001710318954600320336060000500339270000290344270000360347170000350350771000840354271000380362685600570366485600920372199101281924970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         141118t20142014enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783740086 (Hardback)  z9781783740079 (Paperback)  a9781783740093q(pdf)  a9781783740109q(epub)  a9781783740116q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1326219221  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghfre1 aDiderot, Denis,d1713-1784,eauthor.10aNeveu de Rameau.lEnglish00aDenis Diderot's Rameau's Nephewh[electronic resource] :ba multi-media edition /cedited by Marian Hobson ; translated by Kate E.

They talk about chess, about genius, about good and evil, about music, they gossip about the society in which they move, one of extreme inequality, of corruption, of envy, and about the circle of hangers-on in which the down-and-out abides. The down-and-out from time to time is possessed with movements almost like spasms, in which he imitates, he gestures, he rants. And towards half past five, when the warning bell of the Opera sounds, they part, going their separate ways. Probably completed in 1772-73, Denis Diderot's Rameau's Nephew fascinated Goethe, Hegel, Engels and Freud in turn, achieving a literary-philosophical status that no other work by Diderot shares. This interactive, multi-media, colour edition offers a brand new translation of Diderot's famous dialogue, and it also gives the reader much more. Portraits and biographies of the numerous individuals mentioned in the text, from minor actresses to senior government officials, enable the reader to see the people Diderot describes, and provide a window onto the complex social and political context that forms the backdrop to the dialogue.

In 66 BCE, after decades of inconclusive struggle, the tribune Manilius proposed a bill that would give supreme command in the war against Mithridates to Pompey the Great, who had just swept the Mediterranean clean of another menace: the pirates. While powerful aristocrats objected to the proposal, which would endow Pompey with unprecedented powers, the bill proved hugely popular among the people, and one of the praetors, Marcus Tullius Cicero, also hastened to lend it his support. In his first ever political speech, variously entitled pro lege Manilia or de imperio Gnaei Pompei, Cicero argues that the war against Mithridates requires the appointment of a perfect general and that the only man to live up to such lofty standards is Pompey. In the section under consideration here, Cicero defines the most important hallmarks of the ideal military commander and tries to demonstrate that Pompey is his living embodiment. This course book offers a portion of the original Latin text, study aids with vocabulary, and a commentary. Designed to stretch and stimulate readers, the incisive commentary will be of particular interest to students of Latin at both AS and undergraduate level. It extends beyond detailed linguistic analysis and historical background to encourage critical engagement with Cicero's prose and discussion of the most recent scholarly thought."--Publisher's website.  aTranslated from the Latin.10aPompey,cthe Great,d106-48 B.C.10aCicero, Marcus Tullius.tDe imperio Cn.

Or might empirical data prompt a scientific hypothesis of time travel? Structured on a fascinating dialogue involving a distinguished physicist, Dr. Rufus, a physics graduate student and a computer scientist this book probes an experimentally supported hypothesis of backwards time travel - and in so doing addresses key metaphysical issues, such as causation, identity over time and free will. The setting is the Jefferson National Laboratory during a period of five days in 2010. Dr. Rufus's experimental search for the psi-lepton and the resulting intractable data spurs the discussion on time travel. She and her two colleagues are pushed by their observations to address the grandfather paradox and other puzzles about backwards causation, with attention also given to causal loops, multi-dimensional time, and the prospect that only the present exists. Sensible solutions to the main puzzles emerge, ultimately advancing the case for time travel really being possible. A Time Travel Dialogue addresses the possibility of time travel, approaching familiar paradoxes in a rigorous, engaging, and fun manner. It follows in the long philosophical tradition of using dialogue to present philosophical ideas and arguments, but is ground breaking in its use of the dialogue format to introduce readers to the metaphysics of time travel, and is also distinctive in its use of lab results to drive philosophical analysis. The discussion of data that might decide whether time is one-dimensional (one timeline) or multi-dimensional (branching time) is especially novel."--Publisher's website.  aThe PDF and epub editions of this book contain animated graphs.

The product of years of painstaking research by one of the world's foremost authorities on Anglo-Russian relations, In the Lands of the Romanovs is the realization of a major bibliographical project that records the details of over 1200 English-language accounts of the Russian Empire. Ranging chronologically from the accession of Mikhail Fedorovich in 1613 to the abdication of Nicholas II in 1917, this is the most comprehensive bibliography of first-hand accounts of Russia ever to be published. Far more than an inventory of accounts by travellers and tourists, Anthony Cross's ambitious and wide-ranging work includes personal records of residence in or visits to Russia by writers ranging from diplomats to merchants, physicians to clergymen, gardeners to governesses, as well as by participants in the French invasion of 1812 and in the Crimean War of 1854-56. Providing full bibliographical details and concise, informative annotation for each entry, this substantial bibliography will be an invaluable tool for anyone with an interest in contacts between Russia and the West during the centuries of Romanov rule."--Publisher's website.  aA free, socially enhanced version of this book is available by clicking on the link on the publisher's website. 0aTravelers' writings, EnglishzRussiavBibliography. 0aVisitors, ForeignzRussiavBibliography. 0aRussiaxDescription and travelvEarly works to 1800vBibliography. 0aRussiaxDescription and travelvBibliography. 0aRussiaxHistoryy1613-1917xSourcesvBibliography.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0042zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0042.jpgzConnect to cover image03253nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026910000490029024500990033926400470043826400110048530000710049633600260056733700260059333800360061950000440065550600480069953800360074754001770078350400370096050504510099752010360144858600560248465000600254065000430260071000380264385600580268185600920273999101283122970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         141121t20142014enkah   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783740284 (Hardback)  z9781783740277 (Paperback)  a9781783740291q(pdf)  a9781783740307q(epub)  a9781783740314q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1091522771  aStSaULbengerda1 aAtkinson, David,d1955 February 23-eauthor.14aThe Anglo-Scottish ballad and its imaginary contextsh[electronic resource] /cDavid Atkinson. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (xviii, 209 pages) :billustrations, facsimiles.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Just like canonical literature and music, the ballad should not be seen as a uniquely authentic item inextricably tied to a documented source, but rather as an unstable structure subject to the vagaries of production, reception, and editing. Among the matters addressed are topics central to the subject, including ballad origins, oral and printed transmission, sound and writing, agency and editing, and textual and melodic indeterminacy and instability. While drawing on the time-honoured materials of ballad studies, the book offers a theoretical framework for the discipline to complement the largely ethnographic approach that has dominated in recent decades. Primarily directed at the community of ballad and folk song scholars, the book will be of interest to researchers in several adjacent fields, including folklore, oral literature, ethnomusicology, and textual scholarship."--Publisher's website.  aWinner of the 2014 Katharine Briggs Folklore Award. 0aBallads, EnglishzGreat BritainxHistory and criticism. 0aBallads, ScotsxHistory and criticism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0041zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0041.jpgzConnect to cover image03558nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026810000370028924501050032626400470043126400110047830000570048933600260054633700260057233800360059850000440063450600480067853800360072654001650076250400530092750503740098052013590135460000330271365100400274665100390278665100500282565100500287571000380292585600570296385600920302099101283143970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr##n#########141121t20142014enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783740130 (Hardback)  z9781783740123 (Paperback)  a9781783740147q(pdf)  a9781783740154q(epub)  a9781783740161q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)878145053  aStSaULbengerda1 aHughes, Michael,d1961-eauthor.10aBeyond Holy Russiah[electronic resource] :bthe life and times of Stephen Graham /cMichael Hughes. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (xii, 357 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Graham walked across large parts of the Tsarist Empire in the years before 1917, describing his adventures in a series of books and articles that helped to shape attitudes towards Russia in Britain and the United States. In later years he travelled widely across Europe and North America, meeting some of the best known writers of the twentieth century, including H.G. Wells and Ernest Hemingway. Graham also wrote numerous novels and biographies that won him a wide readership on both sides of the Atlantic. This book traces Graham's career as a world traveller, and provides a rich portrait of English, Russian and American literary life in the first half of the twentieth century. It also examines how many aspects of his life and writing coincide with contemporary concerns, including the development of New Age spirituality and the rise of environmental awareness.  Beyond Holy Russia is based on extensive research in archives of private papers in Britain and the USA and on the many works of Graham himself. The author describes with admirable tact and clarity Graham's heterodox and convoluted spiritual quest. The result is a fascinating portrait of a man who was for many years a significant literary figure on both sides of the Atlantic."--Publisher's website.10aGraham, Stephen,d1884-1975. 0aRussiaxCivilizationy19th century. 0aRussiaxCivilizationy20th century 0aRussiaxDescription and travely19th century. 0aRussiaxDescription and travely20th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0040zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0040.jpgzConnect to cover image03930nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026804100130028910000300030224501020033226400470043426400110048130000350049233600260052733700260055333800360057950000440061550600480065953800360070754001650074350002050090850400530111350506290116652014100179554600320320565000170323770000430325471000380329785600570333585600920339299101283195970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         141124t20142014enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781909254763 (Hardback)  z9781909254756 (Paperback)  a9781909254770q(pdf)  a9781909254787q(epub)  a9781909254794q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)878145065  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghfre1 aGoyet, Florence,eauthor.14aThe classic short story, 1870-1925h[electronic resource] :btheory of a genre /cFlorence Goyet. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (210 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Yet during the time when the short story was at its most popular-the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries-even the greatest writers followed strict generic conventions that were far from subtle. This expanded and updated translation of Florence Goyet's influential La Nouvelle, 1870-1925: Description d'un genre à son apogée (Paris, 1993) is the only study to focus exclusively on this classic period across different continents. Ranging through French, English, Italian, Russian and Japanese writing-particularly the stories of Guy de Maupassant, Henry James, Giovanni Verga, Anton Chekhov and Akutagawa Ryunosuke-Goyet shows that these authors were able to create brilliant and successful short stories using the very simple 'tools of brevity' of that period. In this challenging and far-reaching study, Goyet looks at classic short stories in the context in which they were read at the time: cheap newspapers and higher-end periodicals. She demonstrates that, despite the apparent intention of these stories to question bourgeois ideals, they mostly affirmed the prejudices of their readers. In doing so, her book forces us to re-think our preconceptions about this 'forgotten' genre."--Publisher's website.  aTranslated from the French. 0aShort story.1 aGoyet, Florence.tNouvelle, 1870-1925.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0039zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0039.jpgzConnect to cover image06400nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202200140023803500210025204000210027324501340029426401460042826400110057430000700058533600260065533700260068133800360070749000530074350000440079650600480084053800360088854002160092450400510114050526020119152015540379360000780534760000590542560000600548470000350554470000290557971000690560871000380567783000540571585600570576985600920582699101283207970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         141121t20132013enkah   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783740185 (hbk.)  z9781783740178 (pbk.)  a9781783740192q(pdf)  a9781783740208q(epub)  a9781783740215q(mobi)  a2054-3611  a(OCoLC)878145044  aStSaULbengerda00aYeats's maskh[electronic resource] :bYeats annual no. 19, a special issue /cedited by Margaret Mills Harper and Warwick Gould. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers in association with the Institute of English Studies School of Advanced Study, University of London,c2013. 4c©2013  a1 online resource (xlii, 453 pages) :billustrations, facsimiles.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aYeats annualx2054-3611 ;vno. 19, special issue  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis entire volume is published under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Fashionable in the age of Wilde, the Mask changes shape until it emerges as Mask in the system of A Vision. Chronologically tracing the concept through Yeats's plays and those poems written as 'texts for exposition' of his occult thought which flowers in A Vision itself (1925 and 1937), the volume also spotlights 'The Mask before The Mask' numerous plays including Cathleen Ni-Houlihan, The King's Threshold, Calvary, The Words upon the Window-pane, A Full Moon in March and The Death of Cuchulain. There are excurses into studies of Yeats's friendship with the Oxford don and cleric, William Force Stead, his radio broadcasts, the Chinese contexts for his writing of 'Lapis Lazuli'. His self-renewal after The Oxford Book of Modern Verse, and the key occult epistolary exchange 'Leo Africanus', edited from MSS by Steve L. Adams and George Mills Harper, is republished from the elusive Yeats Annual No. 1 (1982).    The essays are by David Bradshaw, Michael Cade-Stewart, Aisling Carlin, Warwick Gould, Margaret Mills Harper, Pierre Longuenesse, Jerusha McCormack, Neil Mann, Emilie Morin, Elizabeth Müller and Alexandra Poulain, with shorter notes by Philip Bishop and Colin Smythe considering Yeats's quatrain upon remaking himself and the pirate editions of The Land of Heart's Desire. Ten reviews focus on various volumes of the Cornell Yeats MSS Series, his correspondence with George Yeats, and numerous critical studies."--Publisher's website.10aYeats, W.

According to tradition, the Quechan and other Yuman people were created at the beginning of time, and their Creation myth explains how they came into existence, the origin of their environment, and the significance of their oldest traditions. The Creation myth forms the backdrop against which much of the tribe's extensive oral literature may be understood. At one time there were almost as many different versions of the Quechan creation story as there were Quechan families. Now few people remember them.  This volume, presented in the Quechan language with facing-column translation, provides three views of the origins of the Quechan people. One synthesizes narrator George Bryant's childhood memories and later research. The second is based upon J.P. Harrington's A Yuma Account of Origins (1908). The third provides a modern view of the origins of the Quechan, beginning with the migration from Asia to the New World and ending with the settlement of the Yuman tribes at their present locations. Publication of this book is made possible by the Institute of Museum and Library Services Native American / Native Hawaiian Museum Services Program grant number MN-00-13-0025-13. This collection is for the Quechan people and will also interest linguists, anthropologists, oral literature specialists, and anyone curious about Native American culture."--Publisher's website.  aParallel Quechan and English text. 0aYuman languagesvTexts. 0aYuma IndiansxOrigin. 0aYuman mythology. 0aCreationxMythologyzAmerica.1 aMiller, Amy,d1961-econtributor.2 aCambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.bWorld Oral Literature Project.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWorld oral literature series ;vv. 5.x2054-362X40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0037zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0037.jpgzConnect to cover image04726nam a2200589 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031404100130033510000420034824502920039024600410068224600620072324600400078526400470082526400110087230000660088333600260094933700260097533800360100149000410103750000440107850600480112253800360117054001600120650400770136650504940144352015220193754600320345965000250349165100210351670000400353770000640357770000430364170000640368470000650374870000930381371000380390683000430394485600570398785600920404499101283575970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         141125t20132013enkac   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781909254718 (Hardback)  z9781909254701 (Paperback)  a9781909254725q(pdf)  a9781909254732q(epub)  a9781909254749q(mobi)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)878145069   aStSaULbengerda1 aenghfre1 aMichelet, Jules,d1798-1874,eauthor.10aOn historyh[electronic resource] :bIntroduction to world history (1831) ; Opening address at the Faculty of Letters, 9 January 1834 ; Preface to History of France (1869) /cJules Michelet ; translated by Flora Kimmich, Lionel Gossman, and Edward K.

The first two are available here for the first time in English translation. The third, the Preface to the 1869 edition of the Histoire de France, originally published in its first English translation by Edward K. Kaplan in his Michelet's Poetic Vision (1977), has been revised by the translator for this volume. Curated by leading scholars and translators this volume provides essential reading for anybody interested in modern French and European history. One of the greatest Romantic historians and immensely popular during his lifetime, Jules Michelet (1798-1874) fell into disfavour among the positivist historians who came after him and who regarded his work with disdain as "literature." In the 1920s and 30s, however, he began to be rediscovered and rehabilitated by the members of the influential Annales school. The objects of Michelet's interest-living conditions, popular mentalities, laws and the arts, the historian's relation to the objects of his study, no less than political history-have since come to occupy a central place in modern historical research.

Ibonia is a folktale on epic scale. Much of its plot sounds familiar: a powerful royal hero attempts to rescue his betrothed from an evil adversary and, after a series of tests and duels, he and his lover are joyfully united with a marriage that affirms the royal lineage. These fairytale elements link Ibonia with European folktales, but the tale is still very much a product of Madagascar. It contains African-style praise poetry for the hero; it presents Indonesian-style riddles and poems; and it inflates the form of folktale into epic proportions. Recorded when the Malagasy people were experiencing European contact for the first time, Ibonia proclaims the power of the ancestors against the foreigner. Through Ibonia, Lee Haring expertly helps readers to understand the very nature of folktales. His definitive translation, originally published in 1994, has now been fully revised to emphasize its poetic qualities, while his new introduction and detailed notes give insight into the fascinating imagination and symbols of the Malagasy. Haring's research connects this exotic narrative with fundamental questions not only of anthropology but also of literary criticism."--Publisher's website. 0aMerina (Malagasy people)xFolklore. 0aFolk literature, MalagasyzMadagascarzImerinaxHistory and criticism. 0aEpic literature, MalagasyzMadagascarzImerinaxHistory and criticism. 0aOral traditionzMadagascarzImerina.1 aTurin, Mark,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWorld oral literature series ;vv. 4.x2054-362X40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0034zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0034.jpgzConnect to cover image05605nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031304100130033410000330034724000230038024501550040324600280055826400470058626400110063330000890064433600260073333700260075933800360078549000460082150000440086750600480091153800360095954001600099550400420115550515100119752018380270754600390454560000450458465100530462970000760468270000870475871000380484583000430488385600570492685600920498399101283637970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         141121t20132013enkabj  sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783740017 (Hardback)  z9781783740000 (Paperback)  a9781783740024q(pdf)  a9781783740031q(epub)  a9781783740048q(mobi)  z2054-2437 (Print)  a2054-2445 (Online)  a(OCoLC)878145043  aStSaULbengerda0 aenghlat1 aTacitus, Cornelius,eauthor.10aAnnales.pLiber 1510aTacitus, Annals, 15.20-23, 33-45h[electronic resource] :bLatin text, study aids with vocabulary, and commentary /cMathew Owen and Ingo Gildenhard. 30aAnnals, 15.20-23, 33-45 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2013] 4c©2013  a1 online resource (vi, 268 pages) :billustrations, colour maps, genealogical table.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 a[Classics textbooksx2054-2445 ;vvol. 3]  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported licence (CC-BY 3.0).

This section of the text plunges us straight into the moral cesspool that Rome had apparently become in the later years of Nero's reign, chronicling the emperor's fledgling stage career including his plans for a grand tour of Greece; his participation in a city-wide orgy climaxing in his publicly consummated 'marriage' to his toy boy Pythagoras; the great fire of AD 64, during which large parts of central Rome went up in flames; and the rising of Nero's 'grotesque' new palace, the so-called 'Golden House', from the ashes of the city. This building project stoked the rumours that the emperor himself was behind the conflagration, and Tacitus goes on to present us with Nero's gruesome efforts to quell these mutterings by scapegoating and executing members of an unpopular new cult then starting to spread through the Roman empire: Christianity. All this contrasts starkly with four chapters focusing on one of Nero's most principled opponents, the Stoic senator Thrasea Paetus, an audacious figure of moral fibre, who courageously refuses to bend to the forces of imperial corruption and hypocrisy. This course book offers a portion of the original Latin text, study aids with vocabulary, and a commentary. Designed to stretch and stimulate readers, Owen's and Gildenhard's incisive commentary will be of particular interest to students of Latin at both A2 and undergraduate level. It extends beyond detailed linguistic analysis and historical background to encourage critical engagement with Tacitus' prose and discussion of the most recent scholarly thought."--Publisher's website.     aLatin text; commentary in English.10aTacitus, Cornelius.tAnnales.pLiber 15. 0aRomexHistoryyJulio-Claudians, 30 B.C.-68 A.D. 1 aOwen, Mathew,ewriter of commentary,ewriter of supplementary material.1 aGildenhard, Ingo,d1970-ewriter of commentary,ewriter of supplementary material.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aClassics textbooks ;vv. 3.x2054-244540uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0035zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0035.jpgzConnect to cover image03757nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026804100130028910000300030224000340033224501600036626400470052626400110057330000520058433600260063633700260066233800360068850000440072450600480076853800360081654001570085250001860100950400530119550504150124852012210166361000460288465000450293065000410297565100390301670000330305571000380308885600570312685600920318399101283721970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         141121t20132013enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781909254015 (Hardback)  z9781909254008 (Paperback)  a9781909254022q(pdf)  a9781909254039q(epub)  a9781909254046q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)878145077  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghita1 aRoncaglia, Sara,eauthor.10aNutrire la città.lEnglish 10aFeeding the cityh[electronic resource] :bwork and food culture of the Mumbai Dabbawalas /cSara Roncaglia ; translated from the Italian by Angela Arnone. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2013] 4c©2013  a1 online resource (234 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported Licence.

Giving employment and status to thousands of largely illiterate villagers from Mumbai's hinterland, this co-operative has been in operation since the late nineteenth century. It provides one of the most efficient delivery networks in the world: only one lunch in six million goes astray. Feeding the City is an ethnographic study of the fascinating inner workings of Mumbai's dabbawalas. Cultural anthropologist Sara Roncaglia explains how they cater to the various dietary requirements of a diverse and increasingly global city, where the preparation and consumption of food is pervaded with religious and cultural significance. Developing the idea of "gastrosemantics" - a language with which to discuss the broader implications of cooking and eating - Roncaglia's study helps us to rethink our relationship to food at a local and global level.

This innovative book provides a collection and analysis of oral narrative traditions as practiced by five Bemba-speaking ethnic groups in Zambia. The integration of newly digitalised audio and video recordings into the text enables the reader to encounter the storytellers themselves and hear their narratives as they were recounted during Robert Cancel's research trips to Zambia. Robert Cancel's thorough critical interpretation, combined with these newly digitalised audio and video materials, makes Storytelling in Northern Zambia a much needed addition to the slender corpus of African folklore studies that deal with storytelling performance. Cancel threads his way between the complex demands of African fieldwork studies, folklore theory, narrative modes, reflexive description and simple documentation and succeeds in bringing to the reader a set of performers and their performances that are vivid, varied and instructive. He illustrates this living narrative tradition with a wide range of examples, and highlights the social status of narrators and the complex local identities that are at play. Cancel's innovative study tells us not only about storytelling but sheds light on the study of oral literatures throughout Africa and beyond.

When new publics consume, manipulate and connect with field recordings and digital cultural archives, their involvement raises important practical and ethical questions. This volume explores the political repercussions of studying marginalised languages; the role of online tools in ensuring responsible access to sensitive cultural materials; and ways of ensuring that when digital documents are created, they are not fossilized as a consequence of being archived. Fieldwork reports by linguists and anthropologists in three continents provide concrete examples of overcoming barriers-ethical, practical and conceptual-in digital documentation projects. Oral Literature in the Digital Age is an essential guide and handbook for ethnographers, field linguists, community activists, curators, archivists, librarians, and all who connect with indigenous communities in order to document and preserve oral traditions. Oral Literature in the Digital Age is part of our World Oral Literature Series in conjunction with the World Oral Literature Project."--Publisher's website. 0aOral traditionxTechnological innovations. 0aFolk literaturexTechnological innovations. 0aAnthropological linguisticsxFieldwork. 0aEndangered languages.1 aTurin, Mark,eeditor.1 aWheeler, Claire,eeditor.1 aWilkinson, Eleanor,eeditor.2 aCambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.bWorld Oral Literature Project.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWorld oral literature series ;vv. 2.x2054-362X 0aDigital humanities series.x2054-242940uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0032zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0032.jpgzConnect to cover image06164nam a2200661 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000270019502000260022202200230024802200230027103500210029404000210031504100130033604300120034924502810036126400460064226400110068830000530069933600210075233700230077333800320079649000580082850000440088650600480093053800360097854002200101450002920123450002170152650001860174350400510192950509250198052016910290554600280459665000280462465000280465270000800468070000620476070000320482270000310485470000430488570000410492870000330496970000300500270000480503270000330508070000330511371001160514671000380526283000530530085600570535385600920541099101284464970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         141127t20142014enkc    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783740932 (Hardback)  z9781909254855 (Paperback)  a9781909254879q(pdf)  a9781909254886q (epub)  a9781909254893q(mobi)  z2050-7933 (Print)   a2054-362X (Online)  a(OCoLC)906935170  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghcai  an-usu--00aStories from Quechan oral literatureh[electronic resource] /cA.M.

They are well known as warriors, artists, and traders, and they also have a rich oral tradition. The stories in this volume were told by tribal elders in the 1970s and early 1980s. The eleven narratives in this volume take place at the beginning of time and introduce the reader to a variety of traditional characters, including the infamous Coyote and also Kwayúu the giant, Old Lady Sanyuuxáv and her twin sons, and the Man Who Bothered Ants. This book makes a long-awaited contribution to the oral literature and mythology of the American Southwest, and its format and organization are of special interest. Narratives are presented in the original language and in the storytellers' own words. A prosodically-motivated broken-line format captures the rhetorical structure and local organization of the oral delivery and calls attention to stylistic devices such as repetition and syntactic parallelism. Facing-page English translation provides a key to the original Quechan for the benefit of language learners. The stories are organized into "story complexes", that is, clusters of narratives with overlapping topics, characters, and events, told from diverse perspectives. In presenting not just stories but story complexes, this volume captures the art of storytelling and illuminates the complexity and interconnectedness of an important body of oral literature. Stories from Quechan Oral Literature provides invaluable reading for anyone interested in Native American cultural heritage and oral traditions more generally."--Publisher's website.  aIn Quechan and English. 0aYuman languagesvTexts. 0aYuma IndiansxFolklore.1 aHalpern, Abraham M.q(Abraham Meyer)d1914-1985,econtributor,etranslator.1 aMiller, Amy,d1961-ewriter of introduction,etranslator.1 aCarr, Rosita,econtributor.1 aComet, John,econtributor.1 aEscalante, Jessie Webb,econtributor. 1 aEscalanti, Mary Kelly,econtributor.1 aHartt, Josefa,econtributor.1 aKelly, Tom,econtributor.1 aLevy, Barbara Abramoff,d1949-etranslator.1 aBryant, George,etranslator.1 aRomero, Millie,etranslator.2 aCambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.bWorld Oral Literature Project,ehost institution.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWorld oral literature series ;vv. 6.x2054-362X40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0049zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0049.jpgzConnect to cover image02632nam a2200397 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026810000360028924500820032526400470040726400110045430000370046533600260050233700260052833800360055450000440059050600480063453800360068254001830071850400520090150502180095352008520117165000240202371000380204785600570208585600920214299101284512970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         141127t20132013enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781909254459 (Hardback)  z9781909254442 (Paperback)  a9781909254466q(pdf)  a9781909254473q(epub)  a9781909254480q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)849894257  aStSaULbengerda1 aVelleman, James David,eauthor.10aFoundations for moral relativismh[electronic resource] /cJ.

David Velleman shows that different communities can indeed be subject to incompatible moralities, because their local mores are rationally binding. At the same time, he explains why the mores of different communities, even when incompatible, are still variations on the same moral themes. The book thus maps out a universe of many moral worlds without, as Velleman puts it, "moral black holes". The five self-standing chapters discuss such diverse topics as online avatars and virtual worlds, lying in Russian and truth-telling in Quechua, the pleasure of solitude and the fear of absurdity. Accessibly written, Foundations for Moral Relativism presupposes no prior training in philosophy."--Publisher's website. 0aEthical relativism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0029zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0029.jpgzConnect to cover image05487nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202200140023803500210025204000210027324501540029426401460044826400110059430000960060533600260070133700260072733800360075349000530078950000440084250600480088653800360093454001600097050400510113050520510118152011800323260000570441260000780446960000590454760000600460670000290466671000690469571000380476483000540480285600570485685600920491399101284526970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         141121t20132013enkah   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781909254367 (hbk.)  z9781909254350 (pbk.)  a9781909254374q(pdf)  a9781909254374q(epub)  a9781909254398q(mobi)  a2054-3611  a(OCoLC)849917845  aStSaULbengerda04aThe living streamh[electronic resource] :bessays in memory of A.

Norman Jeffares.       Memories of the man are shared by Seamus Heaney, Christopher Rush and Colin Smythe, who compiles a bibliography of Jeffares's work. Terence Brown, Neil Corcoran, Warwick Gould, Joseph M. Hassett, Phillip L. Marcus, Ann Saddlemyer, Ronald Schuchard, Deirdre Toomey and Helen Vendler offer essays on such topics as Yeats and the Colours of Poetry, Yeats's Shakespeare, Yeats and Seamus Heaney, Lacrimae Rerum and Tragic Joy, Raftery's work on Yeats's Thoor Ballylee, Edmund Dulac's portrait of Mrs George Yeats, The Tower as an anti-Modernist monument, with close studies of 'Vacillation', 'Her Triumph', and 'The Cold Heaven'.    Throughout, the essays are inflected with memories of Jeffares and his critical methods. The volume is rounded with further essays on A Vision by Neil Mann and Matthew de Forrest, while reviews of recent editions and studies are provided by Matthew Campbell, Wayne K.

His discovery and excavation of Tell Halaf in Syria marked an important contribution to knowledge of the ancient Middle East, while his massive study of the Bedouins is still consulted by scholars today. He was also an ardent German patriot, eager to support his country's pursuit of its "place in the sun". Excluded by his part-Jewish ancestry from the regular diplomatic service, Oppenheim earned a reputation as "the Kaiser's spy" because of his intriguing against the British in Cairo, as well as his plan, at the start of the First World War, to incite Muslims under British, French and Russian rule to a jihad against the colonial powers. After 1933, despite being half-Jewish according to the Nuremberg Laws, Oppenheim was not persecuted by the Nazis. In fact, he placed his knowledge of the Middle East and his connections with Muslim leaders at the service of the regime. Ranging widely over many fields-from war studies to archaeology and banking history-The Passion of Max von Oppenheim tells the gripping and at times unsettling story of one part-Jewish man's passion for his country in the face of persistent and, in his later years, genocidal anti-Semitism."--Publisher's website.10aOppenheim, Max,cFreiherr von,d1860-1946. 10aOppenheim, Max,cFreiherr von,d1860-1946xKnowledgexOrient. 0aDiplomatszGermanyvBiography. 0aMiddle East specialistszGermanyvBiography. 0aGermanyxForeign relationszMiddle East.  0aMiddle EastxForeign relationszGermany. 2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0030zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0030.jpgzConnect to cover image04029nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031324501240033426400470045826400110050530000520051633600260056833700260059433800360062049000530065650000440070950600480075353800360080154002140083750400570105150518630110865000620297165000720303365000580310565000710316365000450323470000310327971000380331083000500334885600570339885600920345599101284794970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         141128t20122012enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781909254268 (Hardback)  z9781909254251 (Paperback)  a9781909254275q(pdf)  a9781909254282q(epub)  a9781909254299q(mobi)  z2054-2410 (Print)  z2054-2429 (Online)  a(OCoLC)824609321  aStSaULbengerda00aDigital humanities pedagogyh[electronic resource] :bpractices, principles and politics /cedited by Brett D.

This unprecedented situation calls for a reform of religious cultures that promote a large ideal family size. Many observers assume that Christianity is inevitably part of this problem because it promotes "family values" and statistically, in America and elsewhere, has a higher birthrate than nonreligious people. This book explores diverse ideas about human reproduction in the church past and present. It investigates an extreme fringe of U.S. Protestantism, including the Quiverfull movement, that use Old Testament "fruitful" verses to support natalist ideas explicitly promoting higher fecundity. It also challenges the claim by some natalists that Martin Luther in the 16th century advocated similar ideas. This book argues that natalism is inappropriate as a Christian application of Scripture, especially since rich populations' total footprints are detrimental to biodiversity and to human welfare. It explores the ancient cultural context of the Bible verses quoted by natalists. Challenging the assumption that religion normally promotes fecundity, the book finds surprising exceptions among early Christians (with a special focus on Saint Augustine) since they advocated spiritual fecundity in preference to biological fecundity. Finally the book uses a hermeneutic lens derived from Genesis 1, and prioritising the modern problem of biodiversity, to provide ecological interpretations of the Bible's "fruitful" verses."--Publisher's website. 0aFertility, HumanxMoral and ethical aspectszUnited States. 0aHuman reproductionxMoral and ethical aspectszUnited States. 0aHuman reproductionxBiblical teaching.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0048zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0048.jpgzConnect to cover image04825nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028524501170030626400470042326400110047030000540048133600260053533700260056133800360058750000440062350600480066753800360071554001650075150400510091650515320096752014780249965000330397765000430401065000340405365000740408770000310416171000380419285600570423085600920428799101293757970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         200131t20202020enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783748402 (hbk.)  z9781783748396 (pbk.)  a9781783748419q(pdf)  a9781783748426q(epub)  a9781783748433q(mobi)  a9781783748440q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1170506228  aStSaULbengerda00aDigital technology and the practices of humanities researchh[electronic resource] /cedited by Jennifer Edmond. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (294 pages) :b2 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

How does digitisation shape scholarly identity? How do we negotiate trust in the digital realm? What is scholarship, what forms can it take, and how does it acquire authority? This diverse set of essays demonstrate the importance of asking such questions, bringing together established and emerging scholars from a variety of disciplines, at a time when data is increasingly being incorporated as an input and output in humanities sources and publications. Major themes addressed include the changing nature of scholarly publishing in a digital age, the different kinds of 'gate-keepers' for scholarship, and the difficulties of effectively assessing the impact of digital resources. The essays bring theoretical and practical perspectives into conversation, offering readers not only comprehensive examinations of past and present discourse on digital scholarship, but tightly-focused case studies. This timely volume illuminates the different forces underlying the shifting practices in humanities research today, with especial focus on how humanists take ownership of, and are empowered by, technology in unexpected ways. Digital Technology and the Practices of Humanities Research is essential reading for scholars, students, and general readers interested in the changing culture of research practices in the humanities, and in the future of the digital humanities on the whole."--Publisher's website.  0aHumanitiesxData processing. 0aHumanitiesxResearchxData processing. 0aDigital humanitiesxResearch. 0aCommunication in learning and scholarshipxTechnological innovations.1 aEdmond, Jennifer,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0192zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0192.jpgzConnect to cover image04516nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025504100130027610000420028924502800033126400470061126400110065830000350066933600260070433700260073033800360075649000660079250000440085850600480090253800360095054001650098650000700115150400690122150504280129054600540171852017140177260000590348663000270354565000360357265000510360865000140365970000830367371000380375683000550379485600570384985600920390699101297606970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         200220t20202020enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783746767 (hbk.)  z9781783746750 (pbk.)  a9781783746774q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1142767623  aStSaULbengerda0 aenghheb1 aKhan, Geoffrey,eauthor,etranslator.14aThe Tiberian pronunciation tradition of Biblical Hebrew.nVolume 1h[electronic resource] :bincluding a critical edition and English translation of the sections on consonants and vowels in the Masoretic Treatise Hidāyat al-Qāriʾ 'Guide for the reader' /cGeoffrey Khan. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (762 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 1  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

While Dürer's treatise had been translated earlier in the sixteenth-century into French and Latin, it was Gallucci's Italian translation that endured in popularity as the most cited version of the text in later Baroque treatises, covering topics that were seen as central to arts education, connoisseurship, patronage, and the wider appreciation of the studia humanitatis in general.  The text centres on the relationships between beauty and proportion, macrocosm and microcosm: relationships that were not only essential to the visual arts in the early modern era, but that cut across a range of disciplines - music, physiognomics and humoral readings, astronomy, astrology and cosmology, theology and philosophy, even mnemonics and poetry. In his version of the text, Gallucci expanded the educational potential of the treatise by adding a Preface, a Life of Dürer, and a Fifth Book providing a philosophical framework within which to interpret Dürer's previous sections.  This translation is the first to make these original contributions by Gallucci accessible to an English-speaking audience. Gallucci's contributions illuminate the significance of symmetry and proportion in the contemporary education of the early modern era, informing our understanding of the intellectual history of this period, and the development of art theory and criticism. This is a valuable resource to early modern scholars and students alike, especially those specialising in history of art, philosophy, history of science, and poetry."--Publisher's website.  10aGallucci, Giovanni Paolo,d1538-1621?tDella simmetria dei corpi humani.10aDürer, Albrecht,d1471-1528.tFour books on human proportion. 0aHuman figures in artvEarly works to 1800. 0aProportion (Art)vEarly works to 1800.1 aHutson, James,etranslator,ewriter of introduction.12iContainer of (manifestation):aGallucci, Giovanni Paolo,d1538-1621?tDella simmetria dei corpi humani.lEnglish.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0198zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0198.jpgzConnect to cover image04745nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000360030624500850034226400470042726400110047430000540048533600260053933700260056533800360059150000440062750600480067153800360071954001650075550400530092050514220097352016020239565000230399765000310402065000120405165000490406371000380411285600570415085600920420799101317843970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         200403t20202020enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783748761 (hbk.)  z9781783748754 (pbk.)  a9781783748778q(pdf)  a9781783748785q(epub)  a9781783748792q(mobi)  a9781783748808q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1151507612  aStSaULbengerda1 aWeissman, Davidd1936-eauthor.00aAgencyh[electronic resource] :bmoral identity and free will /cDavid Weissman. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (210 pages) :b2 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Or we make a conceptual leap and ask more abstract questions about the conditions for agency. They include autonomy and self-appraisal, each contested by arguments immersing us in circumstances we don't control. But can it be true we that have no personal responsibility for all we think and do? Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will proposes that deliberation, choice, and free will emerged within the evolutionary history of animals with a physical advantage: organisms having cell walls or exoskeletons had an internal space within which to protect themselves from external threats or encounters. This defense was both structural and active: such organisms could ignore intrusions or inhibit risky behavior.  Their capacities evolved with time: inhibition became the power to deliberate and choose the manner of one's responses.  Hence the ability of humans and some other animals to determine their reactions to problematic situations or to information that alters values and choices.  This is free will as a material power, not as the conclusion to a conceptual argument.  Having it makes us morally responsible for much we do. It prefigures moral identity. Closely argued but plainly written, Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will speaks for autonomy and responsibility when both are eclipsed by ideas that embed us in history or tradition.  Our sense of moral choice and freedom is accurate.

Part I (Chapters 1-7) presents models of an economic agent, discussing abstract models of preferences, choice, and decision making under uncertainty, before turning to models of the consumer, the producer, and monopoly. Part II (Chapters 8-14) introduces the concept of equilibrium, beginning, unconventionally, with the models of the jungle and an economy with indivisible goods, and continuing with models of an exchange economy, equilibrium with rational expectations, and an economy with asymmetric information. Part III (Chapters 15-16) provides an introduction to game theory, covering strategic and extensive games and the concepts of Nash equilibrium and subgame perfect equilibrium. Part IV (Chapters 17-20) gives a taste of the topics of mechanism design, matching, the axiomatic analysis of economic systems, and social choice. The book focuses on the concepts of model and equilibrium. It states models and results precisely, and provides proofs for all results. It uses only elementary mathematics (with almost no calculus), although many of the proofs involve sustained logical arguments. It includes about 150 exercises. With its formal but accessible style, this textbook is designed for undergraduate students of microeconomics at intermediate and advanced levels."."--Publisher's website. 0aMicroeconomics. 0aGame theory.1 aRubinstein, Ariel,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0211zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0211.jpgzConnect to cover image04748nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000280030624501360033426400470047026400110051730000620052833600260059033700260061633800360064250000440067850600480072253800360077054001650080650400780097150516450104952013610269465000180405565000240407365000300409771000380412785600570416585600920422299100198607970896620250313114127.0m        d        cr  n         210625t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800642072 (hbk.)  z9781800642065 (pbk.)  a9781800642089q(pdf)  a9781800642096q(epub)  a9781800642102q(mobi)  a9781800642119q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1261028643  aStSaULbengerda1 aBoyer, Pascal,eauthor.10aHuman cultures through the scientific lensh[electronic resource] :bessays in evolutionary cognitive anthropology /cPascal Boyer. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (290 pages) :b10 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

It promotes the perspective of 'integrated' social science, in which social science questions are addressed in a deliberately eclectic manner, combining results and models from evolutionary biology, experimental psychology, economics, anthropology and history. It thus constitutes a welcome contribution to a gradually emerging approach to social science based on E. O. Wilson's concept of 'consilience'. Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens spans a wide range of topics, from an examination of ritual behaviour, integrating neuro-science, ethology and anthropology to explain why humans engage in ritual actions (both cultural and individual), to the motivation of conflicts between groups. As such, the collection gives readers a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the applications of an evolutionary paradigm in the social sciences. This volume will be a useful resource for scholars and students in the social sciences (particularly psychology, anthropology, evolutionary biology and the political sciences), as well as a general readership interested in the social sciences."--Publisher's website.  0aAnthropology. 0aEvolution (Biology) 0aAnthropologyxPsychology.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0257zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0257.jpgzConnect to cover image05761nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031404300120033524501160034726400460046326400110050930000340052033600260055433700260058033800360060649000450064250000440068750600480073153800360077954001650081550004260098050400410140650503980144750510340184552019230287965000330480265000390483565000360487470000370491071000380494774000650498583000440505085600570509485600920515199100199556970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         170314t20172017enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783742691 (Hardback)  z9781783742684 (Paperback)  a9781783742707q(pdf)  a9781783742714q(epub)  a9781783742721q(mobi)  z2399-6668 (Print)  a2399-6676 (Online)  a(OCoLC)980017415   aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk-st00aSecurity in a small nationh[electronic resource] :bScotland, democracy, politics /cedited by Andrew W.

Levels of public interest and engagement were unprecedented, as demonstrated by record-breaking voter turnout. Yet aside from Trident, the issue of security was relatively neglected in the campaigns, and there remains a lack of literature on the topic. In this volume Andrew Neal has collated a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives on security and constitutional change in Scotland and the UK, including writing from experts in foreign policy analysis, intelligence studies, parliamentary studies, and journalism. Security in a Small Nation provides an illuminating analysis of the politics of security. Its authors reflect on a number of related issues including international comparisons, alliances, regional cooperation, terrorism, intelligence sharing, democratic oversight, and media coverage. It has a particular focus on what security means for small states and democratic politics. The book draws on current debates about the extent of intelligence powers and their implications for accountability, privacy, and human rights. It examines the foreign and security policy of other small states through the prism of Scottish independence, providing unique insight into the bureaucratic and political processes associated with multi-level security governance. These contributions provide a detailed picture of the changing landscape of security, including the role of diverse and decentralised agencies, and new security interdependencies within and between states. The analysis presented in this book will inform ongoing constitutional debates in the UK and the study of other secessionist movements around the world. Security in a Small Nation is essential reading for any follower of UK and Scottish politics, and those with an interest in security and nationhood on a global scale."--Publisher's website. 0aNational securityzScotland. 0aInternational relationszScotland. 0aIntelligence servicezScotland.1 aNeal, Andrew W.,d1978-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.0 aSecurity in Scotland, with or without constitutional change. 0aOpen reports series ;vv. 4.x2399-667640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0078zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0078.jpgzConnect to cover image05215nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028504300130030624501130031926400470043226400110047930000630049033600260055333700260057933800360060550000440064150600480068553800360073354001650076950400510093450517400098552017460272565000400447165000430451170000400455471000380459485600570463285600920468999100199879970896620250313114129.0m        d        cr  n         210802t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800641334 (hbk.)  z9781800641327 (pbk.)  a9781800641341q(pdf)  a9781800641358q(epub)  a9781800641365q(mobi)  a9781800641372q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1262131675  aStSaULbengerda  aee----- 00aPolitics and the environment in Eastern Europeh[electronic resource] /cedited by Eszter Krasznai Kovács. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (342 pages) :b27 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Amid these divisions, the environment has become a key battleground. The condition and sustainability of environmental resources are interlinked with systems of governance and power, from local to EU levels. Key challenges in the eastern European region today include increasingly authoritarian forms of government that threaten the operations and very existence of civil society groups; the importation of locally-contested conservation and environmental programmes that were designed elsewhere; and a resurgence in cultural nationalism that prescribes and normalises exclusionary nation-building myths. This volume draws together essays by early-career academic researchers from across eastern Europe. Engaging with the critical tools of political ecology, its contributors provide a hitherto overlooked perspective on the current fate and reception of 'environmentalism' in the region. It asks how emergent forms of environmentalism have been received, how these movements and perspectives have redefined landscapes, and what the subtler effects of new regulatory regimes on communities and environment-dependent livelihoods have been. Arranged in three sections, with case studies from Czechia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Serbia, this collection develops anthropological views on the processes and consequences of the politicisation of the environment. It is valuable reading for human geographers, social and cultural historians, political ecologists, social movement and government scholars, political scientists, and specialists on Europe and European Union politics."--Publisher's website.  0aEnvironmentalismzEurope, Eastern.  0aEnvironmental policyzEurope, Eastern.1 aKovács, Eszter Krasznai,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0244zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0244.jpgzConnect to cover image13087nam a2200625 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000240017002000250019402000250021902200220024402200230026603500220028904000210031124501530033225000190048526400470050426400110055130000360056233600260059833700260062433800360065049000670068650000440075350600480079753800360084554001650088150000480104650000280109450002110112250583440133350506110967752014361028865000311172465000431175565000501179865000261184865000381187465000451191265000321195765000441198965000511203370000371208470000291212170000341215070000321218471000381221683000581225485600571231285600921236999100199919970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         210208t20212021enk     s     000 0 eng d  z9781783748341 (Hardback)  z9781783748334 (Paperback)  a9781783748358 (pdf)  a9781783748365 (epub)  a9781783748372 (mobi)  z2059-4232 (Print)  a2059-4240 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1107450146  aStSaULbengerda00aWhat works in conservationh[electronic resource].n2021 /cedited by William J.

Is the use of organic farming instead of conventional farming beneficial to bat conservation? Does installing wildlife warning reflectors along roads benefit mammal conservation? Does the installation of exclusion and/or escape devices on fishing nets benefit marine and freshwater mammal conservation? What Works in Conservation has been created to provide practitioners with answers to these and many other questions about practical conservation. This book provides an assessment of the effectiveness of 2526 conservation interventions based on summarized scientific evidence. The 2021 edition containssubstantial new material on bat conservation, terrestrial mammal conservation and marine and freshwater mammals, thus completing the evidence for all mammal species categories. Other chapters cover practical global conservation of primates, amphibians, bats, birds, forests, peatlands, subtidal benthic invertebrates, shrublands and heathlands, as well as the conservation of European farmland biodiversity and some aspects of enhancing natural pest control, enhancing soil fertility, management of captive animals and control of freshwater invasive species. It contains key results from the summarized evidence for each conservation intervention and an assessment of the effectiveness of each by international expert panels."--Publisher's website. 0aBiodiversity conservation. 0aBiodiversity conservationxManagement. 0aBiodiversity conservationxGovernment policy. 0aHabitat conservation. 0aHabitat conservationxManagement. 0aHabitat conservationxGovernment policy. 0aEnvironmental conservation. 0aEnvironmental conservationxManagement. 0aEnvironmental conservationxGovernment policy.1 aSutherland, William J.,eeditor.1 aDicks, Lynn V.,eeditor.1 aPetrovan, Silviu O.,eeditor.1 aSmith, Rebecca K.,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWhat works in conservation series ;vv. 6.x2059-424040uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0267zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0267.jpgzConnect to cover image04510nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000280030624501100033426400470044426400110049130000620050233600260056433700260059033800360061650000440065250600480069653800360074454001650078050400530094550514890099852011830248760000610367065000600373165000600379165000260385171000380387785600570391585600920397299100215079970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         210824t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800642133 (hbk.)  z9781800642126 (pbk.)  a9781800642140q(pdf)  a9781800642157q(epub)  a9781800642164q(mobi)  a9781800642171q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1266225733  aStSaULbengerda1 aPaulin, Roger,eauthor.10aFrom Goethe to Gundolfh[electronic resource] :bessays on German literature and culture /cRoger Paulin. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (420 pages) :b27 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

The work represents his major research interests of Romanticism and the reception of Shakespeare in Germany, but also explores a broader range of themes, from poetry and the public memorialization of poets to fairy stories - all meticulously researched, yet highly accessible. As a comprehensive examination of German literary history in the period 1700-1900, the collection not only includes accounts of the lives and work of Goethe, Schiller, the Schlegels, and Gundolf (amongst others), serving to nuance our understanding of these figures in history, but also considers diverse (and often underexplored) topics, from academic freedom to the rise of travel literature. The essays have been reformulated, corrected, and updated to add references to recent works. However, the core foundations of the originals remain, and just as when they were first published, the value of these essays - to researchers, students, and all those who are interested in German literary history - cannot be overstated."--Publisher's website. 10aShakespeare, William,d1564-1616xAppreciationzGermany. 0aGerman literaturey18th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aGerman literaturey19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aRomanticismzGermany.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0258zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0258.jpgzConnect to cover image05398nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026904300070029024501520029726400460044926400110049530000340050633600260054033700260056633800360059250000440062850600480067253800360072054001650075650400530092150512880097452022410226265000570450365000420456065000570460270000330465970000300469270000310472271000380475385600570479185600920484899100215191970896620250313114128.0m        d        cr  n         170424t20172017enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783740880 (Hardback)  z9781783740871 (Paperback)  a9781783740895q(pdf)  a9781783740901q(epub)  a9781783740918q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)987449679   aStSaULbengerda  ae-00aTwentieth-century Russian poetryh[electronic resource] :breinventing the canon /cedited by Katharine Hodgson, Joanne Shelton and Aexandra Smith. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (512 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

A multi-authored study of changing cultural memory and identity, this revisionary work charts Russia's shifting relationship to its own literature in the face of social upheaval. Literary canon and national identity are inextricably tied together, the composition of a canon being the attempt to single out those literary works that best express a nation's culture. This process is, of course, fluid and subject to significant shifts, particularly at times of epochal change. This volume explores changes in the canon of twentieth-century Russian poetry from the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union to the end of Putin's second term as Russian President in 2008. In the wake of major institutional changes, such as the abolition of state censorship and the introduction of a market economy, the way was open for wholesale reinterpretation of twentieth-century poets such as Iosif Brodskii, Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandel'shtam, their works and their lives. In the last twenty years many critics have discussed the possibility of various coexisting canons rooted in official and non-official literature and suggested replacing the term "Soviet literature" with a new definition - "Russian literature of the Soviet period". Contributions to this volume explore the multiple factors involved in reshaping the canon, understood as a body of literary texts given exemplary or representative status as "classics". Among factors which may influence the composition of the canon are educational institutions, competing views of scholars and critics, including figures outside Russia, and the self-canonising activity of poets themselves. Canon revision further reflects contemporary concerns with the destabilising effects of emigration and the internet, and the desire to reconnect with pre-revolutionary cultural traditions through a narrative of the past which foregrounds continuity. Despite persistent nostalgic yearnings in some quarters for a single canon, the current situation is defiantly diverse, balancing both the Soviet literary tradition and the parallel contemporaneous literary worlds of the emigration and the underground."--Publisher's website. 0aRussian poetryy20th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aSoviet poetryxHistory and criticism. 0aPoets, Russiany20th centuryxHistory and criticism.1 aHodgson, Katharine,eeditor.1 aShelton, Joanne,eeditor.1 aSmith, Alexandra,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0076zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0076.jpgzConnect to cover image13922nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031404300120033524501360034726400460048326400110052930000590054033600260059933700260062533800360065149000490068750000440073650600480078053800360082854001100086454001650097450400430113950584790118250501250966150503240978652014271011052013211153765100271285865100381288565100541292365100451297765100401302270000351306270000291309771000381312683000431316485600571320785600921326499100217573970896620250313114128.0m        d        cr  n         170502t20172017enka    sb    001 0 fre d  z9781783743445 (Hardback)  z9781783743438 (Paperback)  a9781783743452q(pdf)  a9781783743469q(epub)  a9781783743476q(mobi)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1006967578  aStSaULbengerda  ae------02aL'idée de l'Europe au Siècle des Lumièresh[electronic resource] /ctextes réunis par Rotraud von Kulessa et Catriona Seth. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (174 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen Book classics seriesx2054-2178 ;vv. 6  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aCet ouvrage est licencié sous une licence internationale Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0).   aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Au Siècle des Lumières, nombre d'hommes et de femmes de lettres ont envisagé l'avenir du continent en particulier pour entériner leur souhait de garantir la paix en Europe. Les textes, réunis dans cette anthologie, et signés des grands écrivains du temps (Rousseau, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Kant, Hume ou encore Staël), comme d'oubliés de l'histoire, présentent, avec quelques excursus chronologiques (de Sully à Hugo) les réflexions de penseurs d'un dix-huitième siècle aux bornes chronologiques étendues - l'émergence et la chute de l'Empire engendrent des bouleversements nombreux -, sur l'Europe, son histoire, sa diversité, mais aussi sur ce qu'ont en commun les nations qui composent, dans leur variété, un ensemble géographique. Ils mettent en évidence les origines historiques d'un projet d'union européenne, le souhait de consolider les liens du continent avec le Maghreb ou la Turquie, l'importance accordée au commerce et les inquiétudes suscitées par les sursauts de l'histoire, mais aussi l'espoir placé dans les générations futures."--Publisher's website.  a"In view of the challenges-many of which are political-that different European countries are currently facing, scholars who work on the 18th century have compiled this anthology which includes earlier recognitions of common values and past considerations of questions which often remain pertinent nowadays. During the Enlightenment, many men and women of letters envisaged the continent's future in particular when stressing their hope that peace could be secured in Europe. The texts gathered here, and signed by major thinkers of the time (Rousseau, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Kant, Hume or Staël for instance), as well as by writers history has forgotten, present the reflections, with a couple of chronological extensions (from Sully to Victor Hugo) of authors from the long eighteenth century-the French Empire and the fall of Napoleon generated numerous upheavals-on Europe, its history, its diversity, but also on what the nations, which, in all their diversity, make up a geographical unit, have in common. They show the historical origins of the project of a European union, the desire to consolidate the continent's ties to the Maghreb or to Turkey, the importance granted to commerce and the worries engendered by history's convulsions, but also the hope vested in future generations."--Publisher's website. 0aEnlightenmentzEurope. 0aEnlightenmentzEuropexInfluence. 0aPolitical culturezEuropexHistoryy18th century. 0aEuropexIntellectual lifey18th century. 0aEuropexCivilizationy18th century.1 aKulessa, Rotraud von,eeditor.1 aSeth, Catriona,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen Book classics ;vv. 6.x2054-217840uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0116zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0116.jpgzConnect to cover image04516nam a2200541 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031304300120033424501310034626400470047726400110052430000610053533600260059633700260062233800360064849000540068450000440073850600480078253800360083054001660086650400410103250507980107352015340187165000280340565000290343365000440346265000450350665000400355165000420359165000440363370000310367770000260370871000380373483000530377285600570382585600920388299100222334970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         170518t20172017enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783743193 (Hardback)  z9781783743186 (Paperback)  a9781783743209q(pdf)  a9781783743216q(epub)  a9781783743223q(mobi)  z2050-7933 (Print)  a2054-362X (Online)  a(OCoLC)993391021  aStSaULbengerda  af------00aSearching for sharingh[electronic resource] :bheritage and multimedia in Africa /cedited by Daniela Merolla and Mark Turin. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (158 pages) :b4 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aWorld oral literature seriesx2054-362X ;vvol. 7  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Taking an innovative and interdisciplinary approach, this volume explores the idea of sharing as a model to construct and disseminate the knowledge of literary heritage with the people who are represented by and in it. Expert contributors interweave sociological analysis with an appraisal of the transformative impact of technology on literary and cultural production. Does technology restrict, constraining the experience of an oral performance, or does it afford new openings for different aesthetic experiences? Topics explored include the Mara Cultural Heritage Digital Library, the preservation of Ewe heritage material, new eresources for texts in Manding languages, and the possibilities of technauriture. This timely and necessary collection also examines to what extent digital documents can be and have been institutionalised in archives and museums, how digital heritage can remain free from co-option by hegemonic groups, and the roles that exist for community voices. A valuable contribution to a fast-developing field, this book is required reading for scholars and students in the fields of heritage, anthropology, linguistics, history and the emerging disciplines of multi-media documentation and analysis, as well as those working in the field of literature, folklore, and African studies. It is also important reading for museum and archive curators."--Publisher's website. 0aOral traditionzAfrica. 0aFolk literaturezAfrica. 0aOral traditionxInteractive multimedia. 0aFolk literaturexInteractive multimedia. 0aCultural propertyxData processing. 0aDigital preservationxSocial aspects. 0aInteractive multimediaxSocial aspects.1 aMerolla, Daniela,eeditor.1 aTurin, Mark,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWorld oral literature series ;vv. 7.x2054-362X40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0111zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0111.jpgzConnect to cover image07961nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025504100130027624501020028926400470039126400110043830000670044933600260051633700260054233800360056849000700060450000440067450600480071853800360076654001650080250000700096750000920103750400430112954600650117250541830123752016040542065000590702465000310708370000360711471000750715071000380722583000550726385600570731885600920737599100269237970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         210916t20212021enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783749423 (hbk.)  z9781783749416 (pbk.)  a9781783749430q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1268148008  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaota02aA handbook and reader of Ottoman Arabich[electronic resource] /cedited by Esther-Miriam Wagner. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (488 pages) :b4 illustrations (some colour)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;v[volume 9]  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Extant texts display a proximity to the vernacular that cannot be encountered in any other surviving historical Arabic material, and thus provide unprecedented access to Arabic language history. This rich material remains very little explored. Traditionally, scholarship on Arabic has focussed overwhelmingly on the literature of the various Golden Ages between the 8th and 13th centuries, whereas texts from the 15th century onwards have often been viewed as corrupted and not worthy of study. The lack of interest in Ottoman Arabic culture and literacy left these sources almost completely neglected in university courses. This volume is the first linguistic work to focus exclusively on varieties of Christian, Jewish and Muslim Arabic in the Ottoman Empire of the 15th to the 20th centuries, and present Ottoman Arabic material in a didactic and easily accessible way. Split into a Handbook and a Reader section, the book provides a historical introduction to Ottoman literacy, translation studies, vernacularisation processes, language policy and linguistic pluralism. The second part contains excerpts from more than forty sources, edited and translated by a diverse network of scholars. The material presented includes a large number of yet unedited texts, such as Christian Arabic letters from the Prize Paper collections, mercantile correspondence and notebooks found in the Library of Gotha, and Garshuni texts from archives of Syriac patriarchs."--Publisher's website.  0aTurkish languagexWritten TurkishxStudy and teaching. 0aTurkish languagevReaders.1 aWagner, Esther-Miriam,eeditor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 9.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0208zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0208.jpgzConnect to cover image06425nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028524501250030626400470043126400110047830000620048933600260055133700260057733800360060350000440063950600480068353800360073154001650076750400390093250536270097152010890459865000220568765000290570970000370573870000290577571000380580485600570584285600920589999100278490970896620250313114127.0m        d        cr  n         211008t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800642614 (hbk.)  z9781800642607 (pbk.)  a9781800642621q(pdf)  a9781800642638q(epub)  a9781800642645q(mobi)  a9781800642652q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1269507130  aStSaULbengerda00aNegotiating climate change in crisish[electronic resource] :ba handbook /cedited by Steffen Böhm and Sian Sullivan. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (472 pages) :b21 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Despite more than thirty years of high-level, global talks on climate change, we are still seeing carbon emissions rise dramatically. This edited volume, comprising leading and emerging scholars and climate activists from around the world, takes a critical look at what has gone wrong and what is to be done to create more decisive action. Composed of twenty-eight essays-a combination of new and republished texts-the anthology is organised around seven main themes: paradigms; what counts?; extraction; dispatches from a climate change frontline country; governance; finance; and action(s). Through this multifaceted approach, the contributors ask pressing questions about how we conceptualise and respond to the climate crisis, providing both 'big picture' perspectives and more focussed case studies. This unique and extensive collection will be of great value to environmental and social scientists alike, as well as to the general reader interested in understanding current views on the climate crisis."--Publisher's website.  0aClimatic changes. 0aSustainable development.1 aBöhm, Steffen,d1973-eeditor.1 aSullivan, Sian,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0265zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0265.jpgzConnect to cover image05309nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500230026304000210028624501820030726400470048926400110053630000630054733600260061033700260063633800360066250000440069850600480074253800360079054001650082650400510099150520230104252015020306565000230456765000200459070000430461070000350465371000380468885600570472685600920478399100282457970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         211022t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800641471 (hbk.)  z9781800641464 (pbk.)  a9781800641488q(pdf)  a9781800641495q(epub)  a9781800641501q(mobi)  a9781800641518q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1276901821   aStSaULbengerda00aCirculation and controlh[electronic resource] :bartistic culture and intellectual property in the nineteenth century /cedited by Marie-Stéphanie Delamaire and Will Slauter. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (540 pages) :b114 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

From lithographs and engraved reproductions of paintings to daguerreotypes, stereoscopic views, and mass-produced sculptures, works of visual art became available in a wider range of media than ever before. But the circulation and reproduction of artworks also raised new questions about the legal rights of painters, sculptors, engravers, photographers, architects, collectors, publishers, and subjects of representation (such as sitters in paintings or photographs). Copyright and patent laws tussled with informal cultural norms and business strategies as individuals and groups attempted to exert some degree of control over these visual creations. With contributions by art historians, legal scholars, historians of publishing, and specialists of painting, photography, sculpture, and graphic arts, this rich collection of essays explores the relationship between intellectual property laws and the cultural, economic, and technological factors that transformed the pictorial landscape during the nineteenth century. This book will be valuable reading for historians of art and visual culture; legal scholars who work on the history of copyright and patent law; and literary scholars and historians who work in the field of book history. It will also resonate with anyone interested in current debates about the circulation and control of images in our digital age."--Publisher's website.  0aArtxReproduction. 0aCopyrightxArt.1 aDelamaire, Marie-Stéphanie,eeditor.1 aSlauter, Will,d1977-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0247zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0247.jpgzConnect to cover image06581nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000300030624500890033624600200042524600220044526400470046726400110051430000610052533600260058633700260061233800360063850000440067450600480071853800360076654001650080250000780096750400530104550534040109852013480450265000400585065000460589071000380593685600570597485600920603199100283402970896620250606163826.0m        d        cr##n#########211022t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800642553 (hbk.)  z9781800642546 (pbk.)  a9781800642560q(pdf)  a9781800642577q(epub)  a9781800642584q(mobi)  a9781800642591q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1277513901  aStSaULbengerda1 aPeek, Philip S.,eauthor.10aAncient Greek Ih[electronic resource] :ba 21st-century approach /cPhilip S.

Peek draws on his twenty-five years of teaching experience to present the ancient Greek language in an imaginative and accessible way that promotes creativity, deep learning, and diversity. The course is built on three pillars: memory, analysis, and logic. Readers memorize the top 250 most frequently occurring ancient Greek words, the essential word endings, the eight parts of speech, and the grammatical concepts they will most frequently encounter when reading authentic ancient texts. Analysis and logic exercises enable the translation and parsing of genuine ancient Greek sentences, with compelling reading selections in English and in Greek offering starting points for contemplation, debate, and reflection.

Informed by an ontological and phenomenological approach, and building mainly, but not exclusively, on the thought of Sartre, Daniel Rueda Garrido considers the concept of a "form of life" as a term that bridges the gap between subjective identity and communities. This first systematic ontology of "forms of life" seeks to understand why we act in certain ways, and why we cling to certain identities, such as nationalisms, social movements, cultural minorities, racism, or religion. The answer, as Rueda Garrido argues, depends on an understanding of ourselves as "forms of life" that remains sensitive to the relationship between ontology and power, between what we want to be and what we ought to be.  Structured in seven chapters, Rueda Garrido's investigation yields illuminating and timely discussions of conversion, the constitution of subjectivity as an intersubjective self, the distinction between imitation and reproduction, the relationship between freedom and facticity, and the dialectical process by which two particular ways of being and acting enter into a situation of assimilation-resistance, as exemplified by capitalist and artistic forms of life. This ambitious and original work will be of great interest to scholars and students of philosophy, social sciences, cultural studies, psychology and anthropology. Its wide-ranging reflection on the human being and society will also appeal to the general reader of philosophy."--Publisher's website. 10aSartre, Jean-Paul,d1905-1980.  0aExistentialism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0259zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0259.jpgzConnect to cover image05010nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000300030624501060033626400470044226400110048930000620050033600260056233600330058833700260062133800360064750000440068350600480072753800360077554001740081150400530098550517100103852015530274865000230430165000240432470000290434871000380437785600570441585600920447299100305894970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         211109t20212021enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781800641952 (hbk.)  z9781800641945 (pbk.)  a9781800641969q(pdf)  a9781800641976q(epub)  a9781800641983q(azw3)  a9781800641990q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1285076842  aStSaULbengerda1 aReid, Darren R.,eauthor.10aDocumentary making for digital humanitiesh[electronic resource] /cDarren R.

It is designed to help scholars and students engage with their subjects using an audio-visual grammar, and to allow readers to efficiently gain the technical and theoretical skills necessary to create and disseminate their own trans-media projects. Documentary Making for Digital Humanists sets out the fundamentals of filmmaking, explores academic discourse on digital documentaries and online distribution, and considers the place of this discourse in the evolving academic landscape. The book walks its readers through the intellectual and practical processes of creating digital media and documentary projects. It is further equipped with video elements, supplementing specific chapters and providing brief and accessible introductions to the key components of the filmmaking process. This will be a valuable resource to humanist scholars and students seeking to embrace new media production and the digital landscape, and to those researchers interested in using means beyond the written word to disseminate their work. It constitutes a welcome contribution to the burgeoning field of digital humanities, as the first practical guide of its kind designed to facilitate humanist interactions with digital filmmaking, and to empower scholars and students alike to create and distribute new media audio-visual artefacts."--Publisher's website.  0aDocumentary films. 0aDigital humanities.1 aSanders, Brett,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0255zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0255.jpgzConnect to cover image03560nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028504100130030610000370031924000300035624500970038626400470048326400110053030000540054133600260059533700260062133800360064750000440068350600480072753800360077554001990081150400530101054600970106350502430116052012070140360000390261060000550264960000580270465000570276270000600281971000380287985600570291785600920297499100308264970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         211123t20212021enk     sb    000 d eng d  z9781800642850 (hbk.)  z9781800642843 (pbk.)  a9781800642867q(pdf)  a9781800642874q(epub)  a9781800642881q(azw3)  a9781800642898q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1308752796  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghlat1 aPlautus, Titus Maccius,eauthor.10aEpidicus.lEnglish.f202110aEpidicus by Plautush[electronic resource] :ban annotated Latin text /cby Catherine Tracy. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (198 pages) :b2 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Epidicus, the cunning slave, is charged with finding his master's illegitimate daughter and the secret girlfriend of his master's son, but a comedy of mistaken identities and competing interests ensues. Amid the mayhem, Epidicus aims to win his freedom whilst risking some of the grislier punishments the Romans inflicted on their unfortunate slaves.  This parallel edition in both Latin and English, with its accessible introduction and comprehensive notes, guides the reader through this popular Roman play. Tracy explores Epidicus's roots in Greek drama, its rich social resonances for a Roman audience and its life in performance. She transforms Plautus' colloquial Latin poetry into lively modern English prose, illuminating the play's many comedic references to the world of the Roman republic.  This fine introduction to an enduring play will be of great use and enjoyment for undergraduate students of Latin drama and the general reader alike."--Publisher's website. 10aPlautus, Titus Maccius.tEpidicus.10aPlautus, Titus MacciusvTranslations into English.10aPlautus, Titus MacciusxCriticism and interpretation. 0aClassical drama (Comedy)vTranslations into English.1 aTracy, Catherine,etranslator,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0269zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0269.jpgzConnect to cover image05437nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024702200230027202200230029503500220031804000210034024501570036125000210051826400460053926400110058530000630059633600260065933700260068533800360071149000440074750000440079150600480083553800360088354001990091950001320111850516850125052014490293565000500438465000510443465000530448570000340453870000340457270000270460671000380463374000420467183000450471385600570475885600920481599100310038970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         200615t20212021enka    sb    000 0deng d  z9781800643512 (Hardback)  z9781800643505 (Paperback)  a9781800643529q(pdf)  a9781800643536q(epub)  a9781800643543q(mobi)  a9781800643550q(XML)  z2399-6668 (Print)   a2399-6676 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1288661528  aStSaULbengerda04aThe great reseth[electronic resource] :b2021 European public investment outlook /cedited by Floriana Cerniglia, Francesco Saraceno and Andrew Watt.    a[Second edition] 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2021. 4c©2021  a1 online resource (258 pages) :b76 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen reports seriesx2399-6676vvol. 10  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

The first examines public investment trends and needs in Europe, addressing the initiatives taken by European governments to tackle the COVID-19 recession and to rebuild their economies. The second identifies key domains where European public investment is needed to build a more sustainable Europe, from climate change to human capital formation. Building on the 2020 edition, The Great Reset demonstrates the value of public capital both within European countries and as a European public good, shedding light on the impact that the NextGenerationEU's Recovery and Resilience Facility will likely have on the macroeconomic structure of the European economy. The first part of the Outlook assesses the state of public investment in Europe at large, as well as focusing on five countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain) as case studies. The second part focuses on the challenges posed by the pandemic and the pillars of the NextGenerationEU investment plan, with chapters ranging from education and digitalization, to territorial cohesion and green transition.  This book is a must-read for economists, policymakers, and scholars interested in the impact and recovery of European countries during a time of extensive uncertainty."--Publisher's website. 0aCOVID-19 (Disease)xEconomic aspectszEurope. 0aPublic investmentsxGovernment policyzEurope. 0aEconomic developmentxGovernment policyzEurope.1 aCerniglia, Floriana,eeditor.1 aSaraceno, Francesco,eeditor.1 aWatt, Andrew,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.2 aA European public investment outlook. 0aOpen reports series ;vv. 10.x2399-667640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0280zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0280.jpgzConnect to cover image03695nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031304300120033410000280034624501330037426400460050726400110055330000620056433600260062633700260065233800360067849000450071450000440075950600480080353800360085154001650088750400670105250504590111952010130157865000470259165000400263865100600267865100600273865100540279865100520285270000300290471000380293483000440297285600570301685600920307399100313394970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         170601t20172017enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783743247 (Hardback)  z9781783743230 (Paperback)  a9781783743254q(pdf)  a9781783743261q(epub)  a9781783743278q(mobi)  z2399-6668 (Print)  a2399-6676 (Online)  a(OCoLC)990516861  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk---1 aO'Brien, Mark,eauthor.10aJust managing?h[electronic resource] :bwhat it means for the families of austerity Britain /cMark O'Brien and Paul Kyprianou. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (244 pages) :b24 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen reports seriesx2399-6676 ;vvol. 5  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

'Hardworking families'. 'Alarm-clock Britain'. In recent years British political discourse has been filled with these slogans, as politicians claim to speak on behalf of families who are in work, but struggling to get by. This book allows us to hear from some of these families directly.  At a time when the impact of austerity is more relevant than ever, Just Managing? cuts through the debates and sloganeering to give some of the real people behind the headlines and statistics a chance to tell their stories. It tracks the lives of thirty working families in Liverpool over one year, as they struggle to manage on incomes at or around the National Minimum Wage. Their accounts are placed within the economic and political context that has shaped their experiences and that of millions of other working families across the country.  This book is required reading for anyone seeking to understand what life is like at the sharp end of 'austerity Britain'."--Publisher's website. 0aPovertyzEnglandzLiverpoolvCase studies. 0aIncome distributionzGreat Britain. 0aLiverpool (England)xEconomic conditionsvCase studies. 0aLiverpool (England)xEconomic conditionsy21st century. 0aGreat BritainxEconomic conditionsy21st century. 0aGreat BritainxSocial conditionsy21st century.1 aKyprianou, Paul,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen reports series ;vv. 5.x2399-667640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0112zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0112.jpgzConnect to cover image04870nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026904300210029010000290031124501510034026400460049126400110053730000620054833600260061033700260063633800360066250000440069850600480074253800360079054001650082650400650099150508590105652018850191565000360380065000350383665000300387165000440390165000770394565100450402265100400406770000400410770000300414771000380417785600570421585600920427299100318005970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         170619t20172017enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783743292 (Hardback)  z9781783743285 (Paperback)  a9781783743308q(pdf)  a9781783743315q(epub)  a9781783743322q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)993268453   aStSaULbengerda  ae------an-cn-on1 aVervaeke, John,eauthor.10aZombies in Western cultureh[electronic resource] :ba twenty-first century crisis /cJohn Vervaeke, Christopher Mastropietro, and Filip Miscevic. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (104 pages) :b13 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

John Vervaeke, Christopher Mastropietro and Filip Miscevic seek to answer this question by arguing that particular aspects of the zombie, common to a variety of media forms, reflect a crisis in modern Western culture. The authors examine the essential features of the zombie, including mindlessness, ugliness and homelessness, and argue that these reflect the outlook of the contemporary West and its attendant zeitgeists of anxiety, alienation, disconnection and disenfranchisement. They trace the relationship between zombies and the theme of secular apocalypse, demonstrating that the zombie draws its power from being a perversion of the Christian mythos of death and resurrection. Symbolic of a lost Christian worldview, the zombie represents a world that can no longer explain itself, nor provide us with instructions for how to live within it. The concept of 'domicide' or the destruction of home is developed to describe the modern crisis of meaning that the zombie both represents and reflects. This is illustrated using case studies including the relocation of the Anishinaabe of the Grassy Narrows First Nation, and the upheaval of population displacement in the Hellenistic period. Finally, the authors invoke and reformulate symbols of the four horseman of the apocalypse as rhetorical analogues to frame those aspects of contemporary collapse that elucidate the horror of the zombie. Zombies in Western Culture: A Twenty-First Century Crisis is required reading for anyone interested in the phenomenon of zombies in contemporary culture. It will also be of interest to an interdisciplinary audience including students and scholars of culture studies, semiotics, philosophy, religious studies, eschatology, anthropology, Jungian studies, and sociology."--Publisher's website. 0aZombiesxPsychological aspects. 0aAlienation (Social psychology) 0aDisplacement (Psychology) 0aPopular culturexPsychological aspects. 0aOjibwa IndianszOntariozKenora RegionxSocial conditionsvCase studies. 0aEuropexSocial conditionsy21st century. 0aEuropexCivilizationy21st century.1 aMastropietro, Christopher,eauthor.1 aMiscevic, Filip,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0113zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0113.jpgzConnect to cover image13663nam a2200625 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031404100130033504300120034813000610036024501390042126400460056026400110060630000620061733600260067933700260070533800360073149000510076750000440081850600480086253800360091054001050094654001640105150002250121550001870144050001590162750400430178650583380182950501671016750506481033454600321098252015251101465100271253965100381256665100541260465100451265865100401270370000351274370000291277871000381280783000431284585600571288885600921294599100321442970896620250313114127.0m        d        cr  n         170818t20172017enka    sb    001 0 ger d  z9781783743995 (Hardback)  z9781783743988 (Paperback)  a9781783744008q(pdf)  a9781783744015q(epub)  a9781783744022q(mobi)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1004031858  aStSaULbengerda1 agerhfre  ae------2 aL'idée de l'Europe au Siècle des Lumières.lGerman04aDie Europaidee im Zeitalter der Aufklärungh[electronic resource] /cText zusammegestellt von Rotraud von Kulessa und Catriona Seth. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (180 pages) :b63 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen Book classics seriesx2054-2178 ;vvol. 8  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aDieses Werk ist lizensiert unter Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0) For more detailed information consult the publisher's website.  aSister edition to both the English translation "The Idea of Europe : Enlightenment perspectives" and the original French version, "L'idée de l'Europe au Siècle des Lumières", also published by Open Book Publishers.  aOriginally published in French as: L'idée de l'Europe au Siècle des Lumières / textes réunis par Rotraud von Kulessa et Catriona Seth.

Bereits im 18. Jahrhundert und zuvor besann man sich auf gemeinsame Werte und eine gemeinsame Geschichte; die damals gestellten Fragen ähneln in vielen Bereichen den heutigen. Die Autoren und Philosophen der Aufklärung haben so bereits über die Möglichkeiten einer europäischen Einigung zwecks Sicherung des Friedens auf dem Kontinent nachgedacht. Die Texte der vorliegenden Anthologie, verfasst sowohl von den großen Denkern der Zeit (Rousseau, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Kant, Hume oder Germaine de Staël) wie auch von weniger bekannten oder gar in Vergessenheit geratenen, präsentieren, mit einigen chronologischen Exkursen (von Sully bis Victor Hugo), die Ideen der Denker eines weit gefassten 18. Jahrhunderts zu Europa, seiner Geschichte, seiner Vielfalt, aber auch zu den Gemeinsamkeiten der Nationen, die trotz ihrer Vielfalt eine geographische Einheit bilden. Die Texte zeigen uns so die historischen Ursprünge des Projektes der europäischen Einigung, erörtern die Vorteile einer assoziierten Türkei und einer Einbindung des Maghreb sowie die Bedeutung des europäischen Handels. Sie verweisen auch auf die durch die historischen Unruhen verursachten Ängste wie auch auf die Zukunftsperspektiven eines vereinten Europas."--Publisher's website. 0aEnlightenmentzEurope. 0aEnlightenmentzEuropexInfluence. 0aPolitical culturezEuropexHistoryy18th century. 0aEuropexIntellectual lifey18th century. 0aEuropexCivilizationy18th century.1 aKulessa, Rotraud von,eeditor.1 aSeth, Catriona,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen Book classics ;vv. 8.x2054-217840uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0127zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0127.jpgzConnect to cover image06676nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026904100280029010000370031824501450035526400460050026400110054630000620055733600260061933700260064533800360067150000440070750600480075153800360079954001650083550400670100054602280106750526460129552017970394165000400573865000320577865000270581065000490583765000530588665000260593970000300596571000380599585600570603385600920609099100324258970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         170619t20172017enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783743490 (Hardback)  z9781783743483 (Paperback)  a9781783743506q(pdf)  a9781783743513q(epub)  a9781783743520q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1086986176  aStSaULbengerda0 aengafroaitahfrohita1 aBryson, Michael,d1964-eauthor.10aLove and its criticsh[electronic resource] :bfrom the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton's Eden /cMichael Bryson and Arpi Movsesian. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (576 pages) :b16 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin'amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur's phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself - in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history."--Publisher's website. 0aLove poetryxHistory and criticism. 0aCourtly love in literature. 0aCourtly lovexHistory. 0aLiterature, MedievalxHistory and criticism. 0aLiteraturey17th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aLovexSocial aspects.1 aMovsesian, Arpi,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0117zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0117.jpgzConnect to cover image03184nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000260031524501160034126400460045726400110050330000620051433600260057633700260060233800360062850000440066450600480070853800360075654001990079250400670099150504070105852010280146565000170249365000220251070000310253271000380256385600570260185600920265899100324707970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         211207t20212021enka    sb    001 0deng d  z9781800642799 (Hardback)  z9781800642782 (Paperback)  a9781800642805q(pdf)  a9781800642812q(epub)  a9781800642829q(azw3)  a9781800642836q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1288423145  aStSaULbengerda1 aBovens, Luc,eauthor.10aCopingh[electronic resource] :ba philosophical guide /cLuc Bovens ; with illustrations by Fiorella Lavado.   1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2021. 4c©2021  a1 online resource (172 pages) :b6 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

We hope for better times, but what is hope, and is it a good thing to hope? How do we look back and make sense of our lives in the face of death? What is the nature of love, and how do we deal with its hardships? What makes for a genuine apology, and is there too much or too little apologizing in this world? Can we bring about changes in ourselves to adapt to our circumstances? How can we make sense of all the good advice-such as, count your blessings, don't cry over spilled milk-that people have on offer? Coping is a perfect companion text for a moral psychology course, a resilience course, or part of an ethics course. The material is written for readers who are new to philosophy and progresses in short self-contained sections. It draws on literature, music, podcasts, and news items. Each chapter has questions for discussion or essay writing and suggestions for material to explore the topic further."--Publisher's website. 0aLife skills. 0aLifexPhilosophy.1 aLavado, Fiorella,eartist.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0268zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0268.jpgzConnect to cover image04897nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000530031524500840036826400460045226400110049830000620050933600260057133700260059733800360062350000440065950600480070353800360075154001740078750000290096150401050099050512690109552016900236460000480405460000610410260000480416365000410421171000380425285600570429085600920434799100324722970896620250506163510.0m        d        cr##n#########211207t20212021enka    sbk   001 0 eng d  z9781800640665 (Hardback)  z9781800640658 (Paperback)  a9781800640672q(pdf)  a9781800640689q(epub)  a9781800640696q(azw3)  a9781800640702q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1289372666  aStSaULbengerda1 aGrant, M.

Grant explores the history of this iconic song, demonstrating how its association with ideas of fellowship, friendship and sociality has enabled it to become so significant for such a wide range of individuals and communities around the world. This engaging study traces different stages in the journey of Auld Lang Syne, from the precursors to the song made famous by Robert Burns to the traditions and rituals that emerged around the song in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including its use as a song of parting, and as a song of New Year. Grant's painstaking study investigates the origins of these varied traditions, and their impact on the transmission of the song right up to the present day. Grant uses Auld Lang Syne to explore the importance of songs and singing for group identity, arguing that it is the active practice of singing the song in group contexts that has made it so significant for so many. The book offers fascinating insights into the ways that Auld Lang Syne has been received, reused and remixed around the world, concluding with a chapter on more recent versions of the song back in Scotland. This highly original and accessible work will be of great interest to non-expert readers as well as scholars and students of musicology, cultural and social history, social anthropology and Scottish studies. The book contains a wealth of illustrations and includes links to many more, including manuscript sources. Audio examples are included for many of the musical examples. Grant's extensive bibliography will moreover ease future referencing of the many sources consulted."--Publisher's website.10aBurns, Robert,d1759-1796.tAuld lang syne.10aBurns, Robert,d1759-1796xCriticism and interpretation.10aMusicy19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aSongs, ScotsxHistory and criticism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0231zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0231.jpgzConnect to cover image10069nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026910000280029024500810031824600700039926400460046926400110051530000620052633600260058833700260061433800360064050000440067650600480072053800360076854001650080450000970096950400380106650567980110452014470790265000320934965000260938170000290940771000380943685600570947485600920953199100328557970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         170807t20172017enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783743896 (Hardback)  z9781783743889 (Paperback)  a9781783743902q(pdf)  a9781783743919q(epub)  a9781783743926q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1004154714  aStSaULbengerda1 aDimmock, Mark,eauthor.10aEthics for A-levelh[electronic resource] /cMark Dimmock and Andrew Fisher.34aEthics for A-level : for AQA Philosophy and OCR Religious Studies 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (262 pages) :b14 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

What role, if any, should intuition have in the formation of moral theory? If something is 'simulated', can it be immoral? This accessible and wide-ranging textbook explores these questions and many more. Key ideas in the fields of normative ethics, metaethics and applied ethics are explained rigorously and systematically, with a vivid writing style that enlivens the topics with energy and wit. Individual theories are discussed in detail in the first part of the book, before these positions are applied to a wide range of contemporary situations including business ethics, sexual ethics, and the acceptability of eating animals. A wealth of real-life examples, set out with depth and care, illuminate the complexities of different ethical approaches while conveying their modern-day relevance. This concise and highly engaging resource is tailored to the Ethics components of AQA Philosophy and OCR Religious Studies, with a clear and practical layout that includes end-of-chapter summaries, key terms, and common mistakes to avoid. It should also be of practical use for those teaching Philosophy as part of the International Baccalaureate. Ethics for A-Level is of particular value to students and teachers, but Fisher and Dimmock's precise and scholarly approach will appeal to anyone seeking a rigorous and lively introduction to the challenging subject of ethics."--Publisher's website. 0aEthicsxStudy and teaching. 0aEthicsvCase studies.1 aFisher, Andrew,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0125zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0125.jpgzConnect to cover image03629nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404300120031510000290032724501170035626400460047326400110051930000630053033600260059333700260061933800360064550000440068150600480072553800360077354001740080950400530098350505730103652012940160960000190290365000500292265000240297271000380299685600570303485600920309199100330080970896620250313114128.0m        d        cr  n         211217t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643390 (Hardback)  z9781800643383 (Paperback)  a9781800643406q(pdf)  a9781800643413q(epub)  a9781800643420q(azw3)  a9781800643437q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1292531041  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk---1 aGraham, Philip,eauthor.10aMary Warnockh[electronic resource] :bethics, education and public policy in post-war Britain /cPhilip Graham. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2021. 4c©2021  a1 online resource (362 pages) :b12 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Warnock was described as 'probably the most celebrated philosopher in Britain.' She began her career as an Oxford University philosophy don and went on to become headmistress of an independent girls' school. Warnock subsequently chaired two select committees which produced reports of lasting significance, first to children with special needs, and second to childless couples. She then became Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge, and an active member of the House of Lords. Alongside these positions, Warnock wrote twenty books, ranging from the fields of philosophy to education and medical ethics. Her ideas were largely in tune with contemporary progressive thinking but late in life Warnock's extreme championing of assisted dying for older people won her enemies even among progressives. This authorised biography, written by a friend of the subject, will be of great value to the general reader with an interest in philosophy, ethics, twentieth-century cultural history, and the changing role of women from the 1950s onwards."--Publisher's website.10aWarnock, Mary. 0aWomen philosopherszGreat BritainvBiography. 0aEthicsxPhilosophy.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0278zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0278.jpgzConnect to cover image03990nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025510000280027624501430030426400470044726400110049430000340050533600260053933700260056533800360059149000710062750000440069850600480074253800360079054001650082650000700099150000920106150400430115350503370119652014560153365000350298965000350302465000350305965000380309465000340313271000750316671000380324183000560327985600570333585600920339299100332150970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         211223t20212021enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781800642973 (hbk.)  z9781800642966 (pbk.)  a9781800642980q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1291009708  aStSaULbengerda1 aPosegay, Nick,eauthor.10aPoints of contact :bthe shared intellectual history of vocalisation in Syriac, Arabic, and Hebrewh[electronic resource] /cNick Posegay. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (390 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;v[volume 10]  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This situation led Syriac, Arabic, and Hebrew scholars to develop new fields of linguistic science in order to better analyse the languages of the Bible and the Qurʾān. Part of this work dealt with the issue of vocalisation in Semitic scripts, which lacked the letters required to precisely record all the vowels in their languages. Semitic scribes thus developed systems of written vocalisation points to better record vowel sounds, first in Syriac, then soon after in Arabic and Hebrew. These new points opened a new field of linguistic analysis, enabling medieval grammarians to more easily examine vowel phonology and explore the relationships between phonetics and orthography. Many aspects of this new field of vocalisation crossed the boundaries between religious communities, first with the spread of 'relative' vocalisation systems prior to the eighth century, and later with the terminology created to name the discrete vowels of 'absolute' vocalisation systems. This book investigates the theories behind Semitic vocalisation and vowel phonology in the early medieval Middle East, tracing their evolution to identify points of intellectual contact between Syriac, Arabic, and Hebrew linguists before the twelfth century."--Publisher's website.  0aHebrew languagexVocalization. 0aSyriac languagexVocalization. 0aArabic languagexVocalization. 0aSemitic languagesxPronunciation. 0aSemitic languagesxPhonetics.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 10.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0271zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0271.jpgzConnect to cover image04951nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000320031524501230034726400460047026400110051630000620052733600260058933700260061533800360064150000440067750600480072153800360076954001650080550400810097050512220105152017960227360000780406960000700414760000290421765000290424665000300427571000380430585600570434385600930440099100332175970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         211223t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643215 (Hardback)  z9781800643208 (Paperback)  a9781800643222q(pdf)  a9781800643239q(epub)  a9781800643246q(azw3)  a9781800643253q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1292364259  aStSaULbengerda1 aKeane, Patrick J.,eauthor.10aMaking the void fruitful :bYeats as spiritual seeker and Petrarchan loverh[electronic resource] /cPatrick J.

Keane questions established understandings of the Irish poet's long fascination with the occult: a fixation that repelled literary contemporaries T.S. Eliot and W.H. Auden, but which enhanced Yeats's vision of life and death.  Through close reading of selected poems, the first section of Making the Void Fruitful assesses Yeats's spiritualised treatment of corporeal themes, exploring sex and eroticism as the expression of a duality inherent to his ontological and supernatural convictions. The power-producing tension in Yeats's work is not only intellectual but emotional. At its vital centre is his Muse: the beautiful political firebrand, Maud Gonne, whose activist Republican politics he considered his one real rival. hrough close engagement with the poems and plays she inspired, the second section explores Yeats's complex relationship with Maud, an obsessive and unrequited love which he sublimated and transformed into the greatest body of Muse poetry since Petrarch, in whose tradition of spiritualized eroticism Yeats, perhaps the last of the great Romantics, was consciously writing. Shaped by the conviction that no modern poet exceeded Yeats in animating the enduring themes of love and spirituality through poetry, this book emphasises the influence, of Blake, Nietzsche, and John Donne, on what Yeats called 'the thinking of the body'. Grounded firmly in the textual materiality of Yeats's oeuvre, this book will be of interest to researchers and students of W.B. Yeats, as well as to those in the fields of Anglophone literatures and cultures, and philosophy."--Publisher's website.10aYeats, W.

During the Enlightenment, many men and women of letters envisaged the continent's future in particular when stressing their hope that peace could be secured in Europe. The texts gathered here, and signed by major thinkers of the time (Rousseau, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Kant, Hume or Staël for instance), as well as by writers history has forgotten, present the reflections, with a couple of chronological extensions (from Sully to Victor Hugo) of authors from the long eighteenth century-the French Empire and the fall of Napoleon generated numerous upheavals-on Europe, its history, its diversity, but also on what the nations, which, in all their diversity, make up a geographical unit, have in common. They show the historical origins of the project of a European union, the desire to consolidate the continent's ties to the Maghreb or to Turkey, the importance granted to commerce and the worries engendered by history's convulsions, but also the hope vested in future generations."--Publisher's website. 0aEnlightenmentzEurope. 0aEnlightenmentzEuropexInfluence. 0aPolitical culturezEuropexHistoryy18th century. 0aEuropexIntellectual lifey18th century. 0aEuropexCivilizationy18th century.1 aSeth, Catriona,eeditor,etranslator.1 aKulessa, Rotraud von,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen Book classics ;vv. 7.x2054-217840uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0123zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0123.jpgzConnect to cover image03460nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000270031524500960034226400460043826400110048430000620049533600260055733700260058333800360060950000440064550600480068953800360073754001740077350400530094750505280100052011790152865000290270765000280273665000250276465100370278971000380282685600570286485600930292199100339071970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         220111t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800642676 (Hardback)  z9781800642669 (Paperback)  a9781800642683q(pdf)  a9781800642690q(epub)  a9781800642706q(azw3)  a9781800642713q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1325960707  aStSaULbengerda1 aPotter, Thea,eauthor.10aHoros :bancient boundaries and the ecology of stoneh[electronic resource] /cThea Potter. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (348 pages) :b8 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Potter weaves this history into a meditation on the ancient philosophical concept of horos, the foundational project of determination and definition, arguing that it is central to the development of classical philosophy and the marketplace. Horos challenges many significant interpretations of ancient thought. With nuance and insight, Potter combines the works of Aristotle, Plato, Homer and archaic Greek inscriptions with the twentieth-century continental philosophy of Heidegger, Derrida and Walter Benjamin. The result is a powerful study of the theme of boundaries in classical Athenian society as evidenced by boundary stones, law and exchange, ontology, insurgency and occupation. The innovative book will be of interest to scholars in the fields of ancient Greek social history, philosophy, and literature, as well as to the general reader who is curious to know more about classical life and philosophy."--Publisher's website. 0aBoundary stoneszGreece. 0aBoundaries (Psychology) 0aPhilosophy, Ancient. 0aGreecexSocial life and customs.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0266zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0266.jpgzConnect to cover image 04254nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000380031524501430035326400460049626400110054230000620055333600260061533700260064133800360066750000440070350600480074753800360079554001740083150400510100550508500105652015960190665000540350265000410355665100360359771000380363385600570367185600920372899100345368970896620250313114128.0m        d        cr  n         220121t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643093 (Hardback)  z9781800643086 (Paperback)  a9781800643109q(pdf)  a9781800643116q(epub)  a9781800643123q(azw3)  a9781800643130q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1298392006  aStSaULbengerda1 aMartinez-Vargas, Carmen,eauthor.10aDemocratising participatory research :bpathways to social justice from the global southh[electronic resource] /cCarmen Martinez-Vargas. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (260 pages) :b9 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Adopting theoretical and empirical approaches, and addressing multiple complex, intersectional issues, this book offers inspiration for scholars and practitioners to open up alternative pathways to social justice, viewed through a Global South lens. Martinez-Vargas examines the colonial roots of research and emphasises the importance of problematising current practices and limitations in order to establish more just and democratic participatory research practices. Although practitioners have been challenging the Western roots of research and participatory research for decades, their goals can be compromised by pluralities and contradictions in the field. This book aims not to replicate past participatory research approaches, but to offer an innovative theoretical foundation-the Capabilities Approach-and an innovative participatory practice called 'Democratic Capabilities Research'. Democratising Participatory Research is not only timely and relevant in South Africa, but also in the Global North owing to the current crisis of values jeopardising the peaceful existence of diverse societies. The book gives essential recommendations for capabilities and human development scholars to reframe their perspectives and uses of the Capabilities Approach, as well as for participatory practitioners to critically reflect on their practices and their often limited conceptualisation of participation."--Publisher's website. 0aSocial sciencesxResearchxCitizen participation. 0aResearchxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aDeveloping countriesxResearch.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0273zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0273.jpgzConnect to cover image05667nam a2200409 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026910000260029024501930031626400460050926400110055530000620056633600260062833700260065433800360068050000440071650600480076053800360080854001650084450400720100950520620108152018120314360000510495560000640500671000380507085600570510885600920516599100348845970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         170919t20172017enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783742240 (Hardback)  z9781783742233 (Paperback)  a9781783742257q(pdf)  a9781783742264q(epub)  a9781783742271q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1006653296  aStSaULbengerda1 aLaing, Tony,eauthor.10aDickens's working notes for Dombey and sonh[electronic resource] :bfacsimiles and transcriptions of the original manuscript with commentary on Dickens's working methods /cby Tony Laing. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (224 pages) :b62 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Drawing on the author's manuscript in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London-and containing hyperlinked facsimiles-Dickens's Working Notes for Dombey and Son offers a new digital transcription with a fresh commentary by Tony Laing. Unique and innovative, this is the only edition to make Dickens's working methods visible. A special feature of our html edition is the high quality of images, which enable the reader to zoom in and out of the manuscript with ease and view small sections of the facsimile or transcription with a single touch. John Mullan has called Dombey and Son Dickens's 'first great novel.' Set amid the coming of the railways, it tells the story of a powerful man-typical of the commercial and banking magnates of the period-and the effect he has on his family and those around him. Laing presents the worksheets and other materials (transcribed for the first time) that together grew into the novel. Reading the book alongside this edition of the notes enlarges the understanding of Dickens's art among teachers, students, researchers and Dickens enthusiasts. As cultural tastes shift from print to digital, Dickens's Working Notes helps preserve Dickens's work for the future. The magnifying and linking functions of the edition mean that the notes are more easily and usefully-not to mention accessibly-exhibited here than elsewhere. Laing gives present-day readers the chance not only to recapture the effect of serial publication but also to gain greater insight into the making of a work which, by general agreement and Dickens's own admission, has a special place in his development as a novelist."--Publisher's website.10aDickens, Charles,d1812-1870.tDombey and son.10aDickens, Charles,d1812-1870xCriticism and interpretation.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0092zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0092.jpgzConnect to cover image04129nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000280031524501240034326400460046726400110051330000620052433600260058633700260061233800360063850000440067450600480071853800360076654001650080250400530096750502290102052019110124965000210316065000350318165000350321665000230325165000350327465000510330965000650336065000230342571000380344885600570348685600920354399100358605970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         171016t20172017enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783743698 (Hardback)  z9781783743681 (Paperback)  a9781783743704q(pdf)  a9781783743711q(epub)  a9781783743728q(mobi)  a9781783744268q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1058400632  aStSaULbengerda1 aSaddiki, Said,eauthor.10aWorld of wallsh[electronic resource] :bthe structure, roles and effectiveness of separation barriers /cSaid Saddiki. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (152 pages) :b11 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Borders have been drawn since the beginning of time, but in recent years artificial barriers have become increasingly significant to the political conversation across the world. Donald Trump was elected President of the United States while promising to build a wall on the Mexico border, and in Europe, the international movements of migrants and refugees have sparked fierce discussion about whether and how countries should restrict access to their territory by erecting physical barriers. Virtual walls are also built and crushed at increasing speed. In the post-9/11 era there is a greater danger from so-called "transnational non-state actors", and computer hacking and cyberterrorism threaten to overwhelm our technological barriers. In this timely and original book, Said Saddiki scrutinises the physical and virtual walls located in four continents, including Israel, India, the southern EU border, Morocco, and the proposed border wall between Mexico and the US. Saddiki's detailed analysis explores the tensions between the rise of globalisation, which some have argued will lead to a "borderless world" and "the end of the nation-state", and the rapid development in recent decades of border control systems. Saddiki examines both regular and irregular cross-border activities, including the flow of people, goods, ideas, drugs, weapons, capital, and information, and explores the disparities that are reflected by barriers to such activities. He considers the consequences of the construction of physical and virtual walls, including their impact on international relations and the rise of the multi-billion dollar security market. World of Walls: The Structure, Roles and Effectiveness of Separation Barriers is important reading for all those interested in the topics of immigration, border security, international relations, and policy."--Publisher's website. 0aBorder security. 0aBorder securityvCase studies. 0aBorder crossingvCase studies. 0aNational security. 0aBoundariesxPolitical aspects. 0aEmigration and immigrationvGovernment policy. 0aEmigration and immigrationvGovernment policyvCase studies. 0aComputer security.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0121zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0121.jpgzConnect to cover image06222nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000250031524501120034026400460045226400110049830000620050933600260057133700260059733800360062350000440065950600480070353800360075154001650078750400530095250527200100552016190372565000460534465000320539065000390542265000370546165000290549865000380552771000380556585600570560385600920566099100358621970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         171016t20172017enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783744046 (Hardback)  z9781783744039 (Paperback)  a9781783744053q(pdf)  a9781783744060q(epub)  a9781783744077q(mobi)  a9781783744275q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1012158524  aStSaULbengerda1 aFog, Agner,eauthor.10aWarlike and peaceful societiesh[electronic resource] :bthe interaction of genes and culture /cAgner Fog. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (364 pages) :b33 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

In this ambitious and wide-ranging book, Agner Fog presents a ground-breaking new argument that explains the existence of differently organised societies using evolutionary theory. It combines natural sciences and social sciences in a way that is rarely seen. According to a concept called regality theory, people show a preference for authoritarianism and strong leadership in times of war or collective danger, but desire egalitarian political systems in times of peace and safety. These individual impulses shape the way societies develop and organise themselves, and in this book Agner argues that there is an evolutionary mechanism behind this flexible psychology. Incorporating a wide range of ideas including evolutionary theory, game theory, and ecological theory, Agner analyses the conditions that make us either strident or docile. He tests this theory on data from contemporary and ancient societies, and provides a detailed explanation of the applications of regality theory to issues of war and peace, the rise and fall of empires, the mass media, economic instability, ecological crisis, and much more. Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture draws on many different fields of both the social sciences and the natural sciences. It will be of interest to academics and students in these fields, including anthropology, political science, history, conflict and peace research, social psychology, and more, as well as the natural sciences, including human biology, human evolution, and ecology."--Publisher's website. 0aNational securityxPsychological aspects. 0aLeadershipzSocial aspects. 0aLeadershipxPsychological aspects. 0aWarfarevCross-cultural studies. 0aEvolutionary psychology. 0aEthnic groupsxPolitical aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0128zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0117.jpgzConnect to cover image04431nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028504100130030604300120031910000370033124000530036824502340042126400470065526400110070230000620071333600260077533700260080133800360082750000440086350600480090753800360095554002100099150000780120150001950127950400530147454600330152750505940156052013710215465000310352565000370355665000390359365100460363270000360367871000380371485600570375285600920380999100366115970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         220211t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800642430 (hbk.)  z9781800642423 (pbk.)  a9781800642447q(pdf)  a9781800642454q(epub)  a9781800642461q(mobi)  a9781800642478q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1312758304  aStSaULbengerda1 aspaheng  as-ck---1 aBaker, Geoffrey,d1970-eauthor.10aRethinking social action through music.lSpanish10aReplanteando la acción social por la músicah[electronic resource] :bla búsqueda de la convivencia y de la ciudadanía en la Red de Escuelas de Música de Medellín /cGeoffrey Baker ; traducción por Claudia García. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2022] 4c©2022  a1 online resource (510 pages) :b31 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aEste trabajo se encuentra protegido por una licencia Creative Commons Atribución/Reconocimiento-NoComercial-Sin Derivados 4.0 Internacional.

Este libro pionero examina el desarrollo de La Red de Escuelas de Música de Medellín, una red de 27 escuelas fundada en 1996 en la segunda ciudad principal de Colombia como respuesta a su reputación como la ciudad más peligrosa en la Tierra. Inspirada en El Sistema, el programa venezolano fundacional de educación musical, La Red es, no obstante, notablemente diferente: su historia es una de múltiples reinvenciones y de una búsqueda continua para mejorar su oferta educativa y alcanzar mejor sus objetivos sociales. Sus reflexiones internas e intentos de transformación arrojan luz valiosa sobre el pasado, el presente y el futuro de ASPM. Basado en un año de trabajo de campo intensivo en Colombia y escrito por Geoffrey Baker, autor de El Sistema: Orchestrating Venezuela's Youth (2014), este importante volumen ofrece nuevas perspectivas sobre ASPM y su evolución tanto en el ámbito académico como en la práctica. Será de interés para un público muy variado: empleados y líderes de programas ASPM; educadores musicales; patrocinadores y responsables políticos; y estudiantes y académicos de campos como ASPM, la educación musical, la etnomusicología y otros campos relacionados."--Publisher's website.  0aMusic and youthzColombia. 0aMusicxSocial aspectszColombia. 0aConservatories of musiczColombia. 0aMedellín (Colombia)xSocial conditions.1 aGarcía, Claudia,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0263zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0263.jpgzConnect to cover image08136nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025504100130027604300130028910000240030224500910032626400470041726400110046430000340047533600260050933700260053533800360056149000670059750000440066450600480070853800360075654001650079250000700095750000920102750400670111950000670118650541690125352015580542265000220698065000650700265000290706765000380709665000370713465000340717165100470720571000750725271000380732783000560736585600570742185600920747899100366242970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         220214t20222022enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643031 (hbk.)  z9781800643024 (pbk.)  a9781800643048q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1322250685  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaheb  aa-iq--- 1 aAloni, Oz,eauthor.14aThe neo-Aramaic oral heritage of the Jews of Zakhoh[electronic resource] /cOz Aloni. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2022] 4c©2022  a1 online resource (370 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 11  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

It carried with it its unique language, culture and customs, many of which bore resemblance to those found in classical rabbinic literature. Like others in Kurdistan, for example, the Jews of Zakho retained a vibrant tradition of creating and performing songs based on embellishing biblical stories with Aggadic traditions. Despite the recent growth of scholarly interest into Neo-Aramaic communities, however, studies have to this point almost exclusively focused on the linguistic analysis of their critically endangered dialects and little attention has been paid to the sociological, historical and literary analysis of the cultural output of the diverse and isolated Neo-Aramaic communities of Kurdistan. In this innovative book, Oz Aloni seeks to redress this balance. Aloni focuses on three genres of the Zakho community's oral heritage: the proverb, the enriched biblical narrative and the folktale. Each chapter draws on the author's own fieldwork among members of the Zakho community now living in Jerusalem. He examines the proverb in its performative context, the rewritten biblical narrative of Ruth, Naomi and King David, and a folktale with the unusual theme of magical gender transformation. Insightfully breaking down these examples with analysis drawn from a variety of conceptual fields, Aloni succeeds in his mission to put the speakers of the language and their culture on equal footing with their speech."--Publisher's website.  0aAramaic language. 0aAramaic languagexDialectszIraqzKurdistānvDictionaries. 0aAramaic languagevTexts. 0aJewszIraqzZākhūxLanguages. 0aJewszIraqzZākhūxFolklore. 0aJewszIraqzZākhūvTexts. 0aZākhū (Iraq)xSocial life and customs.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 11.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0272zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0272.jpgzConnect to cover image03138nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000280031524500880034326400460043126400110047730000340048833600260052233700260054833800360057450000440061050600480065453800360070254001650073850400530090350505850095652009030154165000260244465000230247065000240249371000380251785600570255585600920261299100368589970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         171103t20172017enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742844 (Hardback)  z9781783742837 (Paperback)  a9781783742851q(pdf)  a9781783742868q(epub)  a9781783742875q(mobi)  a9781783744381q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1014200322  aStSaULbengerda1 aMcBride, Mark,eauthor.10aBasic knowledge and conditions on knowledgeh[electronic resource] /cMark McBride. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (238 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

In this stimulating and rigorous book, Mark McBride explores two sets of issues in contemporary epistemology: the problems that warrant transmission poses for the category of basic knowledge; and the status of conclusive reasons, sensitivity, and safety as conditions that are necessary for knowledge. To have basic knowledge is to know (have justification for) some proposition immediately, i.e., knowledge (justification) that doesn't depend on justification for any other proposition. This book considers several puzzles that arise when you take seriously the possibility that we can have basic knowledge. McBride's analysis draws together two vital strands in contemporary epistemology that are usually treated in isolation from each other. Additionally, its innovative arguments include a new application of the safety condition to the law."--Publisher's website. 0aKnowledge, Theory of. 0aCognitive science. 0aPhilosophy of mind.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0104zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0104.jpgzConnect to cover image04863nam a2200589 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024702200230027202200230029503500220031804000210034004100180036104300120037924502080039126400460059926400110064530000540065633600260071033700260073633800360076249000580079850000440085650600480090053800360094854001650098450000460114950400570119550504490125252018360170154600820353765000250361965000270364465000290367165000480370065000480374870000310379670000530382770000370388071001160391771000380403383000530407185600570412485600920418199100368927970896620250313114127.0m        d        cr  n         171106t20172017enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783743841 (Hardback)  z9781783743834 (Paperback)  a9781783743858q(pdf)  a9781783743865q(epub)  a9781783743872q(mobi)  a9781783744398q(XML)  z2050-7933 (Print)   a2054-362X (Online)  a(OCoLC)1014194054  aStSaULbengerda0 aengdmondchi  aa-cc-ti00aLong narrative songs from the Mongghul of Northeast Tibeth[electronic resource] :btexts in Mongghul, Chinese and English /ctranslated by Limusishiden ; edited and with an introduction by Gerald Roche. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (470 pages) :b2 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 a[World oral literature seriesx2054-362X ;vvolume 8]  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

These songs represent the apogee of Mongghul oral literature, and they provide valuable insights into the lives of Mongghul people-their hopes, dreams, and worries. They bear testimony to the impressive plurilingual repertoire commanded by some Mongghul singers: the original texts in Tibetan, Mongghul, and Chinese are here presented in Mongghul, Chinese, and English.The kaleidoscope of stories told in these songs include that of Marshall Qi, a chieftain from the Seven Valleys who travels to Luoyang with his Mongghul army to battle rebels; Laarimbu and Qiimunso, a pair of star-crossed lovers who take revenge from beyond the grave on the families that kept them apart; and the Crop-Planting Song and the Sheep Song, which map the physical and spiritual terrain of the Mongghul people, vividly describing the physical and cosmological world in which they exist.This collection of songs is supported by an Introduction by Gerald Roche that provides an understanding of their traditional context, and shows that these works offer insights into the practices of multilingualism in Tibet. Long Narrative Songs from the Mongghul of Northeast Tibet is vital reading for researchers and others working on oral literature, as well as those who study Inner Asia, Tibet, and China's ethnic minorities. Finally, this book is of interest to linguistic anthropologists and sociolinguists, particularly those working on small-scale multilingualism and pre-colonial multilingualism."--Publisher's website.  aParallel texts of ballads in Mongolian, Chinese (Chinese script) and English. 0aFolk songs, Chinese. 0aFolk songs, Mongolian. 0aMongour languagevTexts. 0aMongour languagevTranslating into English. 0aMongour languagevTranslating into Chinese.0 aLimusishiden,etranslator.1 aRoche, Gerald,eeditor,ewriter of introduction.1 aTurin, Mark,ewriter of preface.2 aCambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.bWorld Oral Literature Project,ehost institution.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWorld oral literature series ;vv. 8.x2054-362X40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0124zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0124.jpgzConnect to cover image05343nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404300120031524501420032726400460046926400110051530000620052633600260058833600330061433700260064733800360067350000440070950600480075353800360080154001650083750000550100250400670105750513320112452019270245665000520438365000330443565000660446865000360453470000450457070000470461571000380466285600570470085600920475799100373834970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         171120t20172017enka    sba   001 0 eng d  z9781783743391 (Hardback)  z9781783743384 (Paperback)  a9781783743407q(pdf)  a9781783743414q(epub)  a9781783743421q(mobi)  a9781783744510q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1014192215  aStSaULbengerda  ae-ru---00aModernism and the spiritual in Russian arth[electronic resource] :bnew perspectives /cedited by Louise Hardiman and Nicola Kozicharow. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (318 pages) :b89 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

For many artists of late Imperial Russia - a culture deeply influenced by the regime's adoption of Byzantine Orthodoxy centuries before - questions of religion and spirituality were of paramount importance. As artists and the wider art community experimented with new ideas and interpretations at the dawn of the twentieth century, their relationship with 'the spiritual' - broadly defined - was inextricably linked to their roles as pioneers of modernism. This diverse collection of essays introduces new and stimulating approaches to the ongoing debate as to how Russian artistic modernism engaged with questions of spirituality in the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Ten chapters from emerging and established voices offer new perspectives on Kandinsky and other familiar names, such as Kazimir Malevich, Mikhail Larionov, and Natalia Goncharova, and introduce less well-known figures, such as the Georgian artists Ucha Japaridze and Lado Gudiashvili, and the craftswoman and art promoter Aleksandra Pogosskaia. Prefaced by a lively and informative introduction by Louise Hardiman and Nicola Kozicharow that sets these perspectives in their historical and critical context, Modernism and the Spiritual in Russian Art: New Perspectives enriches our understanding of the modernist period and breaks new ground in its re-examination of the role of religion and spirituality in the visual arts in late Imperial Russia. Of interest to historians and enthusiasts of Russian art, culture, and religion, and those of international modernism and the avant-garde, it offers innovative readings of a history only partially explored, revealing uncharted corners and challenging long-held assumptions."--Publisher's website. 0aModernism (Art)zRussiaxHistoryy20th century. 0aArt, Russiany20th century.  0aPaintingzRussiay20th centuryxCriticism and interpretation. 0aPainterszRussiay20th century.1 aHardiman, Louise,eeditor,econtributor.1 aKozicharow, Nicola,eeditor,econtributor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0115zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0115.jpgzConnect to cover image05028nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404300120031524501520032726400460047926400110052530000720053633600260060833700260063433800360066050000440069650600480074053800360078854001650082450400670098950515120105652014200256865000360398865000440402465000280406865000480409665000370414465100460418165100460422770000300427370000320430371000380433585600570437385600920443099100377074970896620250313114127.0m        d        cr  n         171127t20172017enkab   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783743742 (Hardback)  z9781783743735 (Paperback)  a9781783743759q(pdf)  a9781783743766q(epub)  a9781783743773q(mobi)  a9781783744527q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1014211918  aStSaULbengerda  ae-ru---00aInformation and empireh[electronic resource] :bmechanisms of communication in Russia, 1600-1850 /cedited by Simon Franklin and Katherine Bowers. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (444 pages) :bcolour illustrations, colour maps.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

How did systems of information and communication shape and reflect this extraordinary change? Information and Empire brings together a range of contributions to shed some light on this complex question. Communication networks such as the postal service and the gathering and circulation of news are examined alongside the growth of a bureaucratic apparatus that informed the government about its country and its people. The inscription of space is considered from the point of view of mapping and the changing public 'graphosphere' of signs and monuments. More than a series of institutional histories, this book is concerned with the way Russia discovered itself, envisioned itself and represented itself to its people. Innovative and scholarly, this collection breaks new ground in its approach to communication and information as a field of study in Russia. More broadly, it is an accessible contribution to pre-modern information studies, taking as its basis a country whose history often serves to challenge habitual Western models of development. It is important reading not only for specialists in Russian Studies, but also for students and non-Russianists who are interested in the history of information and communications.

Each vertical reading analyses three same-numbered cantos from the three canticles: Inferno i, Purgatorio i and Paradiso i; Inferno ii, Purgatorio ii and Paradiso ii; etc. Although scholars have suggested before that there are correspondences between same-numbered cantos that beg to be explored, this is the first time that the approach has been pursued in a systematic fashion across the poem. This collection in three volumes offers an unprecedented repertoire of vertical readings for the whole poem. As the first volume exemplifies, vertical reading not only articulates unexamined connections between the three canticles but also unlocks engaging new ways to enter into core concerns of the poem. The three volumes thereby provide an indispensable resource for scholars, students and enthusiasts of Dante. The volume has its origin in a series of thirty-three public lectures held in Trinity College, the University of Cambridge (2012-2016) which can be accessed at the Cambridge Vertical Readings in Dante's Comedy website."--Publisher's website.00aDante Alighieri,d1265-1321.tDivina commediaxCriticism and interpretation.00aDante Alighieri,d1265-1321.tDivina commediaxCriticism, Textual.1 aCorbett, George,eeditor.1 aWebb, Heather,d1976-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0119zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0119.jpgzConnect to cover image06412nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501930031526400460050826400110055430000900056533600260065533700260068133800360070750000440074350600480078753800360083554001740087150003650104550400510141050524640146152016530392565000370557870000390561570000340565470000350568871000380572374000440576185600570580585600920586299100379666970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         220225t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800642010 (Hardback)  z9781800642003 (Paperback)  a9781800642027q(pdf)  a9781800642034q(epub)  a9781800642041q(azw3)  a9781800642058q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1312757807  aStSaULbengerda00aLearning, marginalization, and improving the quality of education in low-income countriesh[electronic resource] /cedited by Daniel A.

This timely volume brings together contributions on current empirical research and analysis of emerging trends that focus on improving the quality of education through better policy and practice, particularly for those who need improved 'learning at the bottom of the pyramid' (LBOP). This volume brings together academic research experts, government officials and field-based practitioners. National and global experts present multiple broad thematic papers - ranging from the effects of migration and improving teaching to the potential of educational technologies, and better metrics for understanding and financing education. In addition, local experts, practitioners and policymakers describe their own work on LBOP issues being undertaken in Kenya, India, Mexico and Ivory Coast. The contributors argue persuasively that learning equity is a moral imperative, but also one that will have educational, economic and social impacts. They further outline how achieving SDG4 will take renewed and persistent effort by stakeholders to use better measurement tools to promote learning achievement among poor and marginalized children. This volume builds on the second international conference on Learning at the Bottom of the Pyramid (LBOP2). It will be an indispensable resource for policymakers, researchers and government thinktanks, and local experts, as well as any readers interested in the implementation of learning equity across the globe."--Publisher's website. 0aEducationzDeveloping countries.1 aWagner, Daniel A.,d1946-eeditor.1 aCastillo, Nathan M.,eeditor.1 aLewis, Suzanne Grant,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.0 aLearning at the bottom of the pyramid. 40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0256zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0256.jpgzConnect to cover image04697nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424502040031526400460051926400110056530000630057633600260063933700260066533800360069150000440072750600480077153800360081954001990085550400660105450511230112052014960224365000470373965000450378665000510383165000360388270000320391870000570395070000330400771000380404085600570407885600920413599100379691970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         220225t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800641891 (Hardback)  z9781800641884 (Paperback)  a9781800641907q(pdf)  a9781800641914q(epub)  a9781800641921q(azw3)  a9781800641938q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1301940433  aStSaULbengerda04aThe form of ideology and the ideology of formh[electronic resource] :bCold War, decolonization and Third World print cultures /cedited by Francesca Orsini, Neelam Srivastava and Laetitia Zecchini. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (342 pages) :b24 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Competing internationalist frameworks produced a flurry of writings that made Asian, African and other world literatures visible to each other for the first time. The book's essays examine a host of print culture formats (magazines, newspapers, manifestos, conference proceedings, ephemera, etc.) and modes of cultural mediation and transnational exchange that enabled the construction of a variously inflected Third-World culture which played a determining role throughout the Cold War. The essays in this collection focus on locations as diverse as Morocco, Tunisia, South Asia, China, Spain, and Italy, and on texts in Arabic, English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish. In doing so, they highlight the combination of local debates and struggles, and internationalist networks and aspirations that found expression in essays, novels, travelogues, translations, reviews, reportages and other literary forms. With its comparative study of print cultures with a focus on decolonization and the Cold War, the volume makes a major contribution both to studies of postcolonial literary and print cultures, and to cultural Cold War studies in multilingual and non-Western contexts, and will be of interest to historians and literary scholars alike."--Publisher's website. 0aAfrican literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aIndic literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aSouth Asian literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aPostcolonialism in literature. 1 aOrsini, Francesca,eeditor.1 aSrivastava, Neelam Francesca Rashmi,d1972-eeditor.1 aZecchini, Laetitia,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0254zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0254.jpgzConnect to cover image04895nam a2200409 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000350031524500950035026400460044526400110049130000620050233600260056433700260059033800360061650000440065250600480069653800360074454001740078050400430095450512020099752020670219960000320426671000380429885600570433685600920439399100379748970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         220225t20222022enka    sb    000 0beng d  z9781800643277 (Hardback)  z9781800643260 (Paperback)  a9781800643284q(pdf)  a9781800643291q(epub)  a9781800643307q(azw3)  a9781800643314q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1302006529  aStSaULbengerda1 aHalloran, William F.,eauthor.10aWilliam Sharp and "Fiona Macleod"h[electronic resource] :ba life /cWilliam F.

A Scottish poet, novelist, biographer, and editor, he began in 1893 to write critically and commercially successful books under the name Fiona Macleod who became far more than a pseudonym. Enlisting his sister to provide the Macleod handwriting, he used the voluminous Fiona correspondence to fashion a distinctive personality for a talented, but remote and publicity-shy woman. Sometimes she was his cousin and other times his lover, and whenever suspicions arose, he vehemently denied he was Fiona. For more than a decade he duped not only the general public but such literary luminaries as George Meredith, Thomas Hardy, Henry James, William Butler Yeats, and E. C. Stedman. Drawing extensively on his letters, his wife Elizabeth Sharp's Memoir, and accounts by friends and associates, this biography provides a lucid and intimate account of William Sharp's life, from his rejection of the dour religion of his Scottish boyhood, his turn to spiritualism, to his role in the Scottish Celtic Revival in the mid-nineties. The biography illuminates his wide network of close male and female friendships, through which he developed advanced ideas about the place of women in society, the constraints of marriage, the fluidity of gender identity, and the complexity of the human psyche. Uniquely this biography reveals the autobiographical content of the writings of Fiona Macleod, the remarkable extent to which Sharp used the feminine pseudonym to disguise his telling and retelling the complex story of his extramarital love affair with a beautiful and brilliant woman.  The biography illuminates not only the talented and conflicted William Sharp, but also the cultural landscape of Great Britain in the late-nineteenth century. From late Pre-Raphaelitism through the "yellow nineties" and on to the excesses of the early twentieth century, Sharp dabbled in all the movements that comprised what some have called the Age of Decadence.

How do we develop policies that offer everyone the best chance to achieve what they want from life? The capability approach, a theoretical framework pioneered by the philosopher and economist Amartya Sen in the 1980s, has become an increasingly influential way to think about these issues. Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice: The Capability Approach Re-Examined is both an introduction to the capability approach and a thorough evaluation of the challenges and disputes that have engrossed the scholars who have developed it. Ingrid Robeyns offers her own illuminating and rigorously interdisciplinary interpretation, arguing that by appreciating the distinction between the general capability approach and more specific capability theories or applications we can create a powerful and flexible tool for use in a variety of academic disciplines and fields of policymaking. This book provides an original and comprehensive account that will appeal to scholars of the capability approach, new readers looking for an interdisciplinary introduction, and those interested in theories of justice, human rights, basic needs, and the human development approach."--Publisher's website. 0aEconomic development. 0aSocial justice. 0aBasic needs.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0130zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0130.jpgzConnect to cover image06224nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000270031524501260034226400460046826400110051430000340052533600260055933700260058533800360061150000440064750600480069153800360073954001650077550400530094050526330099352018400362660000350546665000290550165000290553065000320555971000380559185600570562985600920568699100386861970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         180108t20172017enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783744114 (Hardback)  z9781783744107 (Paperback)  a9781783744121q(pdf)  a9781783744138q(epub)  a9781783744145q(mobi)  a9781783744602q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1019585533  aStSaULbengerda1 aKochan, Jeff,eauthor.10aScience as social existenceh[electronic resource] :bHeidegger and the sociology of scientific knowledge /cJeff Kochan. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (444 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Kochan shows convincingly that these apparently quite different approaches to science are, in fact, largely compatible, even mutually reinforcing. By combining Heidegger with SSK, Kochan argues, we can explicate, elaborate, and empirically ground Heidegger's philosophy of science in a way that makes it more accessible and useful for social scientists and historians of science. Likewise, incorporating Heideggerian phenomenology into SSK renders SKK a more robust and attractive methodology for use by scholars in the interdisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies (STS). Kochan's ground-breaking reinterpretation of Heidegger also enables STS scholars to sustain a principled analytical focus on scientific subjectivity, without running afoul of the orthodox subject-object distinction they often reject. Science as Social Existence is the first book of its kind, unfurling its argument through a range of topics relevant to contemporary STS research. These include the epistemology and metaphysics of scientific practice, as well as the methods of explanation appropriate to social scientific and historical studies of science. Science as Social Existence puts concentrated emphasis on the compatibility of Heidegger's existential conception of science with the historical sociology of scientific knowledge, pursuing this combination at both macro- and micro-historical levels. Beautifully written and accessible, Science as Social Existence puts new and powerful tools into the hands of sociologists and historians of science, cultural theorists of science, Heidegger scholars, and pluralist philosophers of science."--Publisher's website.10aHeidegger, Martin,d1889-1976. 0aKnowledge, Sociology of. 0aSciencexSocial aspects. 0aTechnologyxSocial aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0129zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0129.jpgzConnect to cover image03744nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404300120031510000330032724501210036026400460048126400110052730000610053833600260059933700260062533800360065150000440068750600480073153800360077954001740081550400670098950506200105652013800167665000360305665100300309271000380312285600580316085600920321899100388866970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         220325t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643574 (Hardback)  z9781800643567 (Paperback)  a9781800643581q(pdf)  a9781800643598q(epub)  a9781800643604q(azw3)  a9781800643611q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1306063152  aStSaULbengerda  aa-ja---1 aBlack, John Andrew,eauthor.12aA short history of transport in Japan from ancient times to the presenth[electronic resource] /cJohn Andrew Black. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (322 pages) :b9 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Drawing from New Institutional Economics, Black offers an historically informed critique of contemporary planning using the example of Japan's historical institutions, their particular biases, and the power they have exerted over national and local transport, to identify how reformed institutional arrangements might develop more sustainable and equitable transport services. With chapters addressing each major form of transport, Black examines the predominant role of institutions and individuals - from seventeenth-century shoguns to post-war planners - in transforming Japan's maritime infrastructure, its roads and waterways, and its adoption of rail and air transport. Using a multidisciplinary, comparative, and chronological approach, the book consults a range of technical, cultural, and political sources to tease out these interactions between society and technology. This spirited new contribution to transport studies will attract readers interested in institutional power, the history of transport, and the development of future infrastructure, as well as those with a general interest in Japan."--Publisher's website. 0aTransportationzJapanxHistory. 0aJapanxSocial conditions.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0281zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0281.jpgzConnect to cover image03769nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000390031524500690035426400460042326400110046930000340048033600260051433700260054033800360056650000440060250600480064653800360069454001990073050400530092950505530098252015100153565000310304565000300307665000410310671000380314785600580318585600920324399100395636970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         220509t20222022enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643154 (Hardback)  z9781800643147 (Paperback)  a9781800643161q(pdf)  a9781800643178q(epub)  a9781800643185q(azw3)  a9781800643192q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1321790655  aStSaULbengerda1 aTanasescu, Mihnea,d1984-eauthor.10aEcocene politicsh[electronic resource] /cMihnea Tănăsescu. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (212 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Dismantling the use of the term 'Anthropocene' as a descriptor for our current ecological and political paradigm, this bold and resolutely original contribution proposes a restorative ethics of mutualism. An emancipatory theory intended to re-invigorate human agency in the face of contemporary ecological challenges, it posits an effective means to combat the environmental destruction engendered by modernity. Using ecology alongside European moral and Māori philosophies to re-conceptualise the ecological remit of politics, this book's granular approach questions the role played by contemporary political ontologies in the separation of humans and environments, offering an in-depth view of their renewed interrelation under mutualism. Ecocene Politics will be essential to researchers and students in the fields of politics, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and geography. It will be of further interest to those working in the fields of political ecology, environmental humanities, and Anthropocene studies, as well as to general readers seeking a theoretical approach to the political issues posed by current ecological crises."--Publisher's website. 0aGeopoliticsy21st century. 0aEnvironmental management. 0aEnvironmentalismxPolitical aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0274zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0274.jpgzConnect to cover image05316nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501830031526400460049826400110054430000620055533600260061733700260064333800360066950000440070550600480074953800360079754001990083350400510103250517320108352016400281565000270445565000430448265000410452570000290456670000370459570000370463271000380466985600580470785600930476599100395640970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         220509t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800644052 (Hardback)  z9781800644045 (Paperback)  a9781800644069q(pdf)  a9781800644076q(epub)  a9781800644083q(azw3)  a9781800644090q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1321818795  aStSaULbengerda02aA common good approach to developmenth[electronic resource] :bcollective dynamics of development processes /cedited by Mathias Nebel, Oscar Garza-Vázquez and Clemens Sedmak. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (400 pages) :b34 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Rather than focusing on the outcomes or conditions of development, the contributors concentrate on the quality of development processes, suggesting that a common good dynamic is key in order to trigger development.  Resulting from more than three years of research by an international group of over fifty scholars, the volume advocates for a modern understanding of the common good-rather than a theological or metaphysical good-in societies by emphasising the social practice of 'commoning' at its core. It suggests that the dynamic equilibrium of common goods in a society should be at the centre of development efforts. For this purpose, it develops a matrix of common good dynamics, accounting for how institutions, social norms and common practices interconnect by identifying five key drivers not only of development, but human development (agency, governance, justice, stability, humanity). Based on this matrix, the contributors suggest a possible metric for measuring the quality of these dynamics. The last section of the book highlights the possibilities enabled by this approach through a series of case studies.  The concept of the common good has recently enjoyed a revival and inspired practitioners keen to look beyond the shortcomings of political and economic liberalism. This book builds on those efforts to think beyond the agenda of twentieth-century development policies, and will be of interest to those working in the fields of development, economics, sociology, philosophy and political science."--Publisher's website. 0aDevelopment economics. 0aDevelopment economicsxSocial aspects. 0aDevelopment economicsvCase studies.1 aNebel, Mathias,eeditor.1 aGarza-Vázquez, Oscar,eeditor.1 aSedmak, Clemens,d1971-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0290zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0290.jpgzConnect to cover image 03488nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000280031524500710034326400460041426400110046030000610047133600260053233700260055833800360058450000440062050600480066453800360071254001650074850000800091350400670099350504440106052012180150465000430272265000470276565000420281271000380285485600580289285600920295099100395891970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         220510t20222022enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800644236 (Hardback)  z9781800644229 (Paperback)  a9781800644243q(pdf)  a9781800644250q(epub)  a9781800644267q(azw3)  a9781800644274q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1319010980  aStSaULbengerda1 aMagnus, P.

Musicians describe their own performances as covers, and audiences use the category to organize their listening and appreciation. However, until now philosophers have not had much to say about them. In A Philosophy of Cover Songs, P.D. Magnus demonstrates that philosophy provides a valuable toolbox for thinking about covers; in turn, the philosophy of cover songs illustrates some general points about philosophical method. Lucidly written, the book is divided into three parts: how to think about covers, appreciating covers, and the metaphysics of covers and songs. Along the way, it explores a range of issues raised by covers, from the question of what precisely constitutes a cover, to the history and taxonomy of the category, the various relationships that hold between songs, performances, and tracks, and the appreciation and evaluation of covers. This unique and engaging book will be of interest to those working in philosophy of art, philosophy of music, popular music studies, music history, and musicology, as well as to readers with a general interest in popular music, covers, and how we think about them."--Publisher's website. 0aCover versionsxHistory and criticism. 0aContemporary musicxHistory and criticism. 0aPopular musicxHistory and criticism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0293zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0293.jpgzConnect to cover image04277nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000300031524501540034526400460049926400110054530000690055633600260062533700260065133800360067750000440071350600480075753800360080554001740084150001370101550400530115250504970120552018590170260000350356165000150359665000320361171000380364385600580368185600920373999100395962970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         220509t20222022enkag   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643338 (Hardback)  z9781800643321 (Paperback)  a9781800643345q(pdf)  a9781800643352q(epub)  a9781800643369q(azw3)  a9781800643376q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1316787706  aStSaULbengerda1 aZicari, Massimo,eauthor.14aThe voice of the centuryh[electronic resource] :bthe culture of Italian Bel canto in Luisa Tetrazzini's recorded interpretations /cMassimo Zicari. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (232 pages) :b89 colour illustrations, music.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0).

This innovative work considers the notion of bel canto and the manner in which this vibrant tradition lives in the records of Luisa Tetrazzini (1871-1940), one of the most celebrated sopranos ever. Tetrazzini, whose discographic career includes about 120 recordings, belongs to that generation of inspirational performers who heralded the dawn of a new era of music appreciation, alongside such iconic figures as Enrico Caruso, Adelina Patti and Nellie Melba. Drawing on a vast body of scholarship and a number of contemporary reviews, Massimo Zicari establishes Tetrazzini's role in the Italian operatic tradition and its much disputed set of performing conventions. His transcriptions of her recorded interpretations from Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini and Verdi will prove invaluable to singers and conductors interested in a tradition that goes back to legendary figures such as Jenny Lind and Maria Malibran. The author also discusses her voice quality and technique, tempo flexibility, her use of vibrato and portamento-features of musical performance that question several widely-held, normative views about aesthetics and interpretative tradition. The volume includes eighty-eight musical examples and its closing section consists of the vocal scores of thirteen operatic arias. The musical material (both examples and transcriptions) is entirely original. This unique approach seeks to combine an academic perspective with the making of the music, in the hope that the plea for originality may be enhanced by models from the past."--Publisher's website.10aTetrazzini, Luisa,d1871-1940. 0aBel canto. 0aSopranos (Singers)zItaly. 2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0277zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0277.jpgzConnect to cover image08548nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404100180031510000460033324000450037924501830042426400460060726400110065330000540066433600260071833700260074433800360077050000440080650600480085053800360089854001650093450001300109950400880122954600380131750545580135552016730591365000370758665000570762365000560768065000490773670000700778571000380785585600570789385600920795099100397793970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         180206t20182018enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783743544 (Hardback)  z9781783743537 (Paperback)  a9781783743551q(pdf)  a9781783743568q(epub)  a9781783743575q(mobi)  a9781783744831q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1028584497  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghyidgeng1 aṾaynshṭeyn, B.,d 1866-1946,eauthor.10aDi idishe yunyons in Ameriḳa.lEnglish14aThe Jewish unions in Americah[electronic resource] :bpages of history and memories /cby Bernard Weinstein ; translated and annotated, with an introduction by Maurice Wolfthal. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (334 pages) :b6 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

He found a home in the tenements of New York and for the next fifty years he devoted his life to the struggles of fellow Jewish workers. The Jewish Unions in America blends memoir and history to chronicle this time. It describes how Weinstein led countless strikes, held the unions together in the face of retaliation from the bosses, investigated sweatshops and factories with the aid of reformers, and faced down schisms by various factions, including Anarchists and Communists. He co-founded the United Hebrew Trades and wrote speeches, articles and books advancing the cause of the labor movement. From the pages of this book emerges a vivid picture of workers' organizations at the beginning of the twentieth century and a capitalist system that bred exploitation, poverty, and inequality. Although workers' rights have made great progress in the decades since, Weinstein's descriptions of workers with jobs pitted against those without, and American workers against workers abroad, still carry echoes today. The Jewish Unions in America is a testament to the struggles of working people a hundred years ago. But it is also a reminder that workers must still battle to live decent lives in the free market. For the first time, Maurice Wolfthal's readable translation makes Weinstein's Yiddish text available to English readers. It is essential reading for students and scholars of labor history, Jewish history, and the history of American immigration."--Publisher's website. 0aJewsxEmploymentzUnited States. 0aMigrant laborzUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aLabor unionszUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aEmployeeszUnited StatesxSocial conditions.1 aWolfthal, Maurice,etranslator,eeditor,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0118zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0118.jpgzConnect to cover image05339nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026904300120029010000320030224501530033426400460048726400110053330000630054433600260060733700260063333800360065950000440069550600480073953800360078754001990082350400530102250519320107552015210300761000310452861000410455965100340460065100710463471000380470585600580474385600920480199100406740970896620250313114127.0m        d        cr  n         220527t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783744626 (Hardback)  z9781783744619 (Paperback)  a9781783744633q(pdf)  a9781783744640q(epub)  a9781783744657q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1099628716  aStSaULbengerda  ae-gr---1 aSt Clair, William,eauthor.10aWho saved the Parthenon?h[electronic resource] :ba new history of the Acropolis before, during and after the Greek Revolution /cWilliam St Clair. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (896 pages) :b191 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Focusing particularly on the question of who saved the Parthenon from destruction during this conflict, with the help of documents that shed a new light on this enduring question, he explores the contributions made by the Philhellenes, Ancient Athenians, Ottomans and the Great Powers. Marshalling a vast amount of primary evidence, much of it previously unexamined and published here for the first time, St Clair rigorously explores the multiple ways in which the Parthenon has served both as a cultural icon onto which meanings are projected and as a symbol of particular national, religious and racial identities, as well as how it illuminates larger questions about the uses of built heritage. This book has a companion volume with the classical Parthenon as its main focus, which offers new ways of recovering the monument and its meanings in ancient times. St Clair builds on the success of his classic text, The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period, to present this rich and authoritative account of the Parthenon's presentation and reception throughout history. With weighty implications for the present life of the Parthenon, it is itself a monumental contribution to accounts of the Greek Revolution, to classical studies, and to intellectual history."--Publisher's website.20aParthenon (Athens, Greece)20aParthenon (Athens, Greece)xHistory. 0aAthens (Greece)xAntiquities. 0aGreecexHistoryyWar of Independence, 1821-1829xArt and the war. 2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0136zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0136.jpgzConnect to cover image02841nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000290031524501100034426400460045426400110050030000610051133600260057233700260059833800360062450000440066050600480070453800360075254001820078850400530097050504530102352007220147665000180219865000150221671000380223185600580226985600920232799100413149970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         220530t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800646919 (Hardback)  z9781800646902 (Paperback)  a9781800646926q(pdf)  a9781800646933q(epub)  a9781800646940q(azw3)  a9781800646957q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1326219221  aStSaULbengerda1 aRappert, Brian,eauthor.10aPerforming deceptionh[electronic resource] :blearning, skill and the art of conjuring /cBrian Rappert. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (230 pages) :b5 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Through this novel meditation on reasoning and skill, Rappert elevates magic from the undertaking of mere trickery to an art that offers the basis for rethinking our possibilities for acting in the modern world. Performing Deception covers a wide range of theories in sociology, philosophy, psychology and elsewhere in order to offer a striking assessment of the way secrecy and deception are woven into social interactions, as well as the illusionary and paradoxical status of expertise."--Publisher's website. 0aMagic tricks. 0aDeception.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0295zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0295.jpgzConnect to cover image05257nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026904100190029024500650030926400460037426400110042030000340043133600260046533700260049133800360051750000440055350600480059753800360064554001940068150400550087554600980093050515900102852018450261865000530446365000560451670000640457271000380463685600570467485600920473199100420679970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         180226t20182018enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783743148 (Hardback)  z9781783743131 (Paperback)  a9781783743155q(pdf)  a9781783743162q(epub)  a9781783743179q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1028618298  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghyroageng03aAn Anglo-Norman readerh[electronic resource] /cJane Bliss. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (416 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0).

It presents a distinctive variety of Anglo-Norman works, beginning in the twelfth century and ending in the nineteenth, covering a broad range of genres and writers, introduced in a lively and thought-provoking way. Facing-page translations, into accessible and engaging modern English, are provided throughout, bringing these texts to life for a contemporary audience. The collection offers a selection of fascinating passages, and whole texts, many of which are not anthologised or translated anywhere else. It explores little-known byways of Arthurian legend and stories of real-life crime and punishment; women's voices tell history, write letters, berate pagans; advice is offered on how to win friends and influence people, how to cure people's ailments and how to keep clear of the law; and stories from the Bible are retold with commentary, together with guidance on prayer and confession. Each text is introduced and elucidated with notes and full references, and the material is divided into three main sections: Story (a variety of narrative forms), Miscellany (including letters, law and medicine, and other non-fiction), and Religious (saints' lives, sermons, Bible commentary, and prayers). Passages in one genre have been chosen so as to reflect themes or stories that appear in another, so that the book can be enjoyed as a collection or used as a resource to dip into for selected texts. This anthology is essential reading for students and scholars of Anglo-Norman and medieval literature and culture. Wide-ranging and fully referenced, it can be used as a springboard for further study or relished in its own right by readers interested to discover Anglo-Norman literature that was written to amuse, instruct, entertain, or admonish medieval audiences."--Publisher's website. 0aAnglo-Norman literaturexHistory and criticism.  0aAnglo-Norman literaturevTranslations into English.1 aBliss, Jane,eeditor,ewriter of introduction,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0110zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0110.jpgzConnect to cover image04154nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000410031524501030035626400460045926400110050530000620051633600260057833700260060433800360063050000440066650600480071053800360075854001650079450400550095950510810101452013990209565000240349465000270351871000380354585600570358385600920364099100420724970896620250313114128.0m        d        cr  n         180226t20182018enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783743643 (Hardback)  z9781783743636 (Paperback)  a9781783743650q(pdf)  a9781783743667q(epub)  a9781783743674q(mobi)  a9781783744879q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1028612389  aStSaULbengerda1 aGabler, Hans Walter,d1938-eauthor.10aText genetics in literary modernism and other essaysh[electronic resource] /cHans Walter Gabler. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (410 pages) :b46 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

In these sixteen stimulating contributions, he develops theories of textual criticism and editing that are inflected by our advance into the digital era; structurally analyses arts of composition in literature and music; and traces the cultural implications discernible in book design, and in the canonisation of works of literature and their authors. Distinctive and ambitious, these essays move beyond the concerns of the community of critics and scholars. Gabler responds innovatively to the issues involved and often endeavours to re-think their urgencies by bringing together the orthodox tenets of different schools of textual criticism. He moves between a variety of topics, ranging from fresh genetic approaches to the work of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, to significant contributions to the theorisation of scholarly editing in the digital age. Written in Gabler's fluent style, these rich and elegant compositions are essential reading for literary and textual critics, scholarly editors, readers of James Joyce, New Modernism specialists, and all those interested in textual scholarship and digital editing under the umbrella of Digital Humanities."--Publisher's website. 0aCriticism, Textual. 0aTransmission of texts.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0120zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0120.jpgzConnect to cover image04019nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000270031524500750034226400460041726400110046330000620047433600260053633700260056233800360058850000440062450600480066853800360071654001650075250400550091750506200097252017340159265000190332665000290334565000240337471000380339885600570343685600920349399100424323970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         180308t20182018enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742998 (Hardback)  z9781783742981 (Paperback)  a9781783743001q(pdf)  a9781783743018q(epub)  a9781783743025q(mobi)  a9781783744886q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1030899900  aStSaULbengerda1 aGamez, David,eauthor.10aHuman and machine consciousnessh[electronic resource] /cDavid Gamez. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (234 pages) :b26 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

However, we still know next to nothing about the relationship between consciousness and the brain and we can only speculate about the consciousness of animals and machines. Human and Machine Consciousness presents a new foundation for the scientific study of consciousness. It sets out a bold interpretation of consciousness that neutralizes the philosophical problems and explains how we can make scientific predictions about the consciousness of animals, brain-damaged patients and machines. Gamez interprets the scientific study of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between measurements of consciousness and measurements of the physical world. We can use artificial intelligence to discover these theories and they could make accurate predictions about the consciousness of humans, animals and artificial systems. Human and Machine Consciousness also provides original insights into unusual conscious experiences, such as hallucinations, religious experiences and out-of-body states, and demonstrates how 'designer' states of consciousness could be created in the future. Gamez explains difficult concepts in a clear way that closely engages with scientific research. His punchy, concise prose is packed with vivid examples, making it suitable for the educated general reader as well as philosophers and scientists. Problems are brought to life in colourful illustrations and a helpful summary is given at the end of each chapter. The endnotes provide detailed discussions of individual points and full references to the scientific and philosophical literature."--Publisher's website. 0aConsciousness. 0aConsciousnessxResearch. 0aPhilosophy of mind.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0107zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0107.jpgzConnect to cover image07045nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000240016102000250018502000250021002200220023502200230025703500220028004000210030224501120032324600610043526401460049626400110064230000850065333600260073833700260076433800360079049000530082650000440087950600480092353800360097154001650100750000750117250001540124750400450140150400410144650522200148752022690370760000780597660000630605460000590611770000290617671000690620571000380627483000540631285600570636685600920642399100427506970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         180319t20182018enkah   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783744558 (hbk.)  z9781783744541 (pbk.)  a9781783744565 (pdf)  a9781783744572 (epub)  a9781783744589 (mobi)  z0278-7687 (print)  a2054-3611 (online)  a(OCoLC)1030903320  aStSaULbengerda00aYeats's legaciesh[electronic resource] :bYeats annual no. 21, a special issue /cedited by Warwick Gould.34aYeats's legacies : Yeats annual no. 21 : a special issue 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers in association with the Institute of English Studies School of Advanced Study, University of London,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (lxxii, 612 pages) :bcolour illustrations, colour facsimiles.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aYeats annualx2054-3611 ;vno. 21, special issue  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Hannah Sullivan's brilliant history of Yeats's versecraft challenges Poundian definitions of Modernism; Denis Donoghue offers unique family memories of 1916 whilst tracing the political significance of the Easter Rising; Anita Feldman addresses Yeats's responses to the Rising's appropriation of his symbols and myths, the daring artistry of his ritual drama developed from Noh, his poetry of personal utterance, and his vision of art as a body reborn rather than a treasure preserved amid the testing of the illusions that hold civilizations together in ensuing wars. Warwick Gould looks at Yeats as founding Senator in the new Free State, and his valiant struggle against the literary censorship law of 1929 (with its present-day legacy of Irish anti-blasphemy law still presenting a constitutional challenge). Drawing on Gregory Estate documents, James Pethica looks at the evictions which preceded Yeats's purchase of Thoor Ballylee in Galway; Lauren Arrington looks back at Yeats, Ezra Pound, and the Ghosts of The Winding Stair (1929) in Rapallo. Having co-edited both versions of A Vision, Catherine Paul offers some profound reflections on 'Yeats and Belief'. Grevel Lindop provides a pioneering view of Yeats's impact on English mystical verse and on Charles Williams who, while at Oxford University Press, helped publish the Oxford Book of Modern Verse. Stanley van der Ziel looks at the presence of Shakespeare in Yeats's Purgatory. William H. O'Donnell examines the vexed textual legacy of his late work, On the Boiler while Gould considers the challenge Yeats's intentionalism posed for once-fashionable post-structuralist editorial theory. John Kelly recovers a startling autobiographical short story by Maud Gonne. While nine works of current biographical, textual and literary scholarship are reviewed, Maud Gonne is the focus of debate for two reviewers, as are Eva Gore-Booth, Constance and Casimir Markievicz, Rudyard Kipling, David Jones, T. S. Eliot and his presence on the radio."--Publisher's website.10aYeats, W. B.q(William Butler),d1865-1939xCriticism and interpretation.10aYeats, W.

As consultancy McKinsey have put it, 'Anyone who has researched merger success rates knows that roughly 70% fail'. Yet-mysteriously-M&A activity has boomed across the globe, with a forty-fold increase in deals done each year now compared with four decades ago, in spite of the adverse general evidence. How can it be that talented, energetic, highly skilled, law-abiding, income-maximising participants in the M&A market will often promote mergers that lead to no operating gains, frequently with adverse effects on the wider economy too? Drawing on findings from a wealth of statistical analyses and case evidence from many businesses, the book presents answers to this merger mystery. In a synthesis of ideas from several disciplines, solutions are detected in misaligned incentives, distorted financial engineering and information asymmetry. By revealing how weaknesses at multiple points can interact and cumulate to produce inefficient outcomes, the discussion serves as a corrective to the overwhelmingly positive tone of most commentary on M&A, whilst also advocating changes in participants' contracts, in taxation, and in regulation which could significantly reduce the number of mergers that fail. Designed to be accessible to a wide readership, the book will be of interest to investors, to M&A practitioners and commentators, to researchers and students of economics, political economy, finance, management and accounting, and-importantly-to policy makers working in these areas."--Publisher's website. 0aConsolidation and merger of corporations. 0aConsolidation and merger of corporationsvEconomic aspects. 0aBusiness failures.1 aMeeks, J.

The first volume contains several introductory chapters on language, folkore motifs and narrative style, followed by samples of glossed texts in each language variety. The second volume is the anthology proper, presenting folklore narratives in several distinct varieties of North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic and Northern and Central Kurdish. The stories are accompanied by English translations. The material includes different genres such as folktales, legends, fables and anecdotes, and is organised into seven thematic units.

The first volume contains several introductory chapters on language, folkore motifs and narrative style, followed by samples of glossed texts in each language variety. The second volume is the anthology proper, presenting folklore narratives in several distinct varieties of North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic and Northern and Central Kurdish. The stories are accompanied by English translations. The material includes different genres such as folktales, legends, fables and anecdotes, and is organised into seven thematic units. The folkloristic material of these three communities is shared to a large extent. The anthology is, therefore, a testament to the intimate and long-standing relations between these three ethno-religious communities-relations that existed in a multilingual environment centuries before the modern era of nationalism."--Publisher's website.  0aAramaic languagexDialectszIraq. 0aAramaic languagevTexts. 0aKurdish languagexDialectszIraq. 0aKurdish languagexTexts. 0aJewszIraqxLanguages. 0aJewszIraqxFolklore. 0aJewszIraqvTexts. 0aChristianszIraqxLanguages. 0aChristianszIraqxFolklore. 0aChristianszIraqvTexts. 0aKurdszIraqxLanguages. 0aKurdszIraqxFolklore. 0aKurdszIraqvTexts. 0aIraqxFolklorevTexts.1 aMohammadirad, Masoud,eauthor.1 aMolin, Dorota,eauthor.1 aNoorlander, Paul M.,eauthor.1 aHabeeb Hanna, Lourd,eauthor.1 aAl-Zebari, Aziz Emmanuel,etranslator.1 aAbraham, Salim,etranslator.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 12.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0307zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0307.jpgzConnect to cover image04572nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032010000280034124501210036926400460049026400110053630000590054733600260060633700260063233800360065850000440069450600480073853800360078654001830082250400530100550512570105852015270231565000340384265000270387670000350390371000380393885600580397685600920403499100436855970896620250313114127.0m        d        cr  n         220801t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800644175 (Hardback)  z9781800644168 (Paperback)  a9781800644182q(pdf)  a9781800646766q(HTML)  a9781800644212q(XML)  a9781800644199q(epub)  a9781800644205q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1335598895  aStSaULbengerda1 aHallam, Susan,eauthor.14aThe power of musich[electronic resource] :ban exploration of the evidence /cSusan Hallam and Evangelos Himonides. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xviii, 828 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

A well-signposted text with helpful subheadings, 'The Power of Music: An Exploration of the Evidence' gathers and synthesises research in neuroscience, psychology, and education to develop our understanding of the effects of listening to and actively making music. Its chapters address music's relationship with literacy and numeracy, transferable skills, its impact on social cohesion and personal wellbeing, as well as the roles that music plays in our everyday lives. Considering evidence from large population samples to individual case studies and across age groups, the authors also pose important methodological questions to the research community. 'The Power of Music' defends qualitative research against a requirement for randomised control trials that can obscure the diverse and often fraught contexts in which people of all ages and backgrounds are exposed to, and engage with, music. This magnificent and comprehensive volume allows the evidence about the power of music to speak for itself, thus providing an essential directory for those researching music education and its social, personal, and cognitive impact across human ages and experiences."--Publisher's website. 0aMusicxPsychological aspects. 0aMusicxSocial aspects.1 aEvangelos, Himonides,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0292zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0292.jpgzConnect to cover image05273nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032024501730034126400460051426400110056030000590057133600260063033700260065633800360068250000440071850600480076253800360081054001660084650001010101250400410111350518250115452014880297965000130446765000170448065000360449765000440453370000380457771000380461585600580465385600920471199100436946970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         220801t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800647299 (Hardback)  z9781800647282 (Paperback)  a9781800647305q(pdf)  a9781800647343q(HTML)  a9781800647336q(XML)  a9781800647312q(epub)  a9781800647329q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1346260447  aStSaULbengerda02aA complete guide to maggot therapyh[electronic resource] :bclinical practice, therapeutic principles, production, distribution, and ethics /cedited by Frank Stadler. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xxxiv, 434 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

This edited volume fills the information vacuum and, importantly, makes the current state of knowledge freely accessible. It is the first to provide sound, evidence-based information and guidance covering the entire supply chain from production to treatment.  The chapters are arranged in five parts presenting the latest on clinical practice, the principles of therapeutic action, medicinal maggot production, distribution logistics, and the ethical dimensions of maggot therapy. The contributors have paid particular attention to the challenges encountered in compromised, low-resource healthcare settings such as disasters, conflict, and poverty.  There are still many barriers to the widespread uptake of maggot therapy in healthcare settings. This book will be essential reading for a global audience of doctors, nurses, allied healthcare providers, students, and entrepreneurs with an interest in maggot-assisted wound care. It will be the go-to reference for those who plan, regulate, and coordinate healthcare, and want to establish a maggot therapy program, particularly in low- and middle-income and other compromised healthcare settings where maggot therapy can provide much-needed, affordable, and efficacious wound care."--Publisher's website. 0aMaggots. 0aDebridement. 0aWounds and injuriesxTreatment. 0aWound healingxHandbooks, manuals, etc.1 aStadler, Frank,eeditor,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0300zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0300.jpgzConnect to cover image05182nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000240016102000250018502000250021002200220023502200230025703500220028004000210030224501870032326400460051026400110055630000620056733600260062933700260065533800360068149000500071750000440076750600480081153800360085954001650089550400480106050517250110852012280283365000510406165000630411265000540417565000620422970000320429170000430432370000340436670000290440071000380442983000480446785600570451585600920457299100442525970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         180430t20182018enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783744749 (hbk.)  z9781783744732 (pbk.)  a9781783744756 (pdf)  a9781783744763 (epub)  a9781783744770 (mobi)  z2514-2496 (print)  a2514-250X (online)  a(OCoLC)1033738558  aStSaULbengerda00aRemote captureh[electronic resource] :bdigitising documentary heritage in challenging locations /cedited by Jody Butterworth, Andrew Pearson, Patrick Sutherland and Adam Farquhar. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (192 pages) :b48 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen field guides seriesx2514-250X ;vvol. 1  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Here he focuses particularly on the performing arts. Part one contextualises Our Lady's Tumbler, a French poem of the late 1230s, by comparing it with episodes in the Bible and miracles in a wide variety of medieval European sources. It relates this material to analogues and folklore across the ages from, among others, Persian, Jewish and Hungarian cultures. Part two scrutinizes the reception and impact of the poem with reference to modern European and American literature, including works by the Nobel prize-winner Anatole France, professor-poet Katharine Lee Bates, philosopher-historian Henry Adams and poet W.H. Auden. This innovative collection of sources introduces readers to many previously untranslated texts, and invites them to explore the journey of Our Lady's Tumbler across both sides of the Atlantic. Reading the Juggler of Notre Dame: Medieval Miracles and Modern Remakings will benefit scholars and students alike. The short introductions and numerous annotations shed light on unusual beliefs and practices of the past, making the readings accessible to anyone with an interest in the arts and an openness to the Middle Ages."--Publisher's website.00aTombeor Nostre Dame.lFrench. 0aMedievalism. 0aCivilization, MedievalxInfluence. 0aMiddle AgesxInfluence.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0284zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0284.jpgzConnect to cover image05766nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000240016102000250018502000250021002000240023503500220025904000210028104300210030224501960032326400460051926400110056530000620057633600260063833700260066433800360069050000440072650600480077053800360081854001650085450400510101950517730107052018690284365000300471265000350474265000310477765100360480865100260484465100310487065100420490165100470494370000370499070000340502771000380506185600570509985600920515699100442952970896620250313114128.0m        d        cr  n         180501t20182018enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783743346 (hbk.)  z9781783743339 (pbk.)  a9781783743353 (pdf)  a9781783743360 (epub)  a9781783743377 (mobi)  z9781783744992 (XML)  a(OCoLC)1034633136  aStSaULbengerda  aac-----ae-urk--00aMobilities, boundaries, and travelling ideash[electronic resource] :brethinking translocality beyond Central Asia and the Caucasus /cedited by Manja Stephan-Emmrich and Philipp Schröder. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (380 pages) :b38 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

The chapters scrutinize the capacity of translocality to describe, in new ways, the multiple mobilities, exchange practices and globalizing processes that link places, people and institutions in Central Asia and the Caucasus with others in Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates. Illuminating translocality as a productive concept for studying cross‐regional connectivities and networks, this volume is an important contribution to a lively field of academic discourse. Following new directions in Area Studies, the chapters aim to overcome 'territorial containers' such as the nation‐state or local community, and instead emphasize the significance of processes of translation and negotiation for understanding how meaningful localities emerge beyond conventional boundaries. Structured by the four themes 'crossing boundaries', 'travelling ideas', 'social and economic movements' and 'pious endeavours', this volume proposes three conceptual approaches to translocality: firstly, to trace how it is embodied, narrated, virtualized or institutionalized within or in reference to physical or imagined localities; secondly, to understand locality as a relational concept rather than a geographically bounded unit; and thirdly, to consider cross‐border traders, travelling students, business people and refugees as examples of non-elite mobilities that provide alternative ways to think about what 'global' means today. Mobilities, Boundaries, and Travelling Ideas will be of interest to students and scholars of the anthropology, history and sociology of Central Asia and the Caucasus, as well as for those interested in new approaches to Area Studies."--Publisher's website. 0aLabor mobilityzCaucasus. 0aLabor mobilityzAsia, Central. 0aHuman geographyzCaucasus. 0aHuman geographyzAsia, Central. 0aCaucasusxBoundaries. 0aAsia, CentralxBoundaries. 0aCaucasusxEmigration and immigration. 0aAsia, CentralxEmigration and immigration.1 aStephan-Emmrich, Manja,eeditor.1 aSchröder, Phillip,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0114zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0114.jpgzConnect to cover image03783nam a2200577 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000240016102000250018502000250021002000240023502200220025902200230028103500220030404000210032604100130034710000370036024501270039724600430052424600270056726400460059426400110064030000610065133600260071233700260073833800360076449000560080050000440085650600480090053800360094854001650098450000350114950400480118450505120123252008880174454600460263260000580267865000400273665000440277665000690282065000450288970000310293471000380296583000530300385600570305685600920311399100454617970896620250916152420.0m        d        cr##n#########180503t20182018enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783744695 (hbk.)  z9781783744688 (pbk.)  a9781783744701 (pdf)  a9781783744718 (epub)  a9781783744725 (mobi)  z9781783745050 (XML)  z2050-7933 (Print)  a2054-362X (Online)  a(OCoLC)1034627045  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghkha1 aTham, Soso,d1873-1940,eauthor.00aTales of darkness and lighth[electronic resource] :bSoso Tham's The old days of the Khasis /ctranslated by Janet Hujon.3 aSoso Tham's The old days of the Khasis3 aOld days of the Khasis 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (100 pages) :b3 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aWorld oral literature seriesx2054-362X ;vvolume 9  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Poet of landscape, myth and memory, Soso Tham paid rich and poignant tribute to his tribe in his masterpiece The Old Days of the Khasis. Janet Hujon's vibrant new translation presents the English reader with Tham's long poem, which keeps a rich cultural tradition of the Khasi people alive through its retelling of old narratives and acts as a cultural signpost for their literary identity. This book is essential reading for anyone with an interest in Indian literature and culture and in the interplay between oral traditions and written literary forms. This edition includes: English translation ; Critical apparatus ; Embedded audio recordings of the original poem."--Publisher's website.  aTexts of poems translated from the Khasi.10aTham, Soso,d1873-1940xCriticism and interpretation. 0aKhasi (Indic people) in literature. 0aKhasi (Indic people)xFolklorexPoetry. 0aKhasi (Indic people)zIndiazMeghalayaxSocial life and customs. 0aKhasi poetryvTranslations into English.1 aHujon, Janet,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWorld oral literature series ;vv. 9.x2054-362X40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0137zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0137.jpgzConnect to cover image09770nam a2200613 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000240017002000250019402000250021902200220024402200230026603500220028904000210031124501690033225000380050126400460053926400110058530000600059633600260065633700260068233800360070849000670074450000600081150000440087150600480091553800360096354001650099950000280116450558360119252013610702865000310838965000430842065000500846365000260851365000380853965000450857765000320862265000440865465000510869870000370874970000290878670000300881570000340884570000320887971000380891183000580894985600570900785600920906499100463730970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         180528t20182018enka    s     000 0 eng d  z9781783744299 (Hardback)  z9781783744282 (Paperback)  a9781783744305 (pdf)  a9781783744312 (epub)  a9781783744329 (mobi)  z2059-4232 (Print)  a2059-4240 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1043403164  aStSaULbengerda00aWhat works in conservationh[electronic resource].n2018 /cedited by William J.

Guthke examines the ways in which, for European scholars and writers of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, world-wide geographical exploration led to an exploration of the self. Guthke explains how in the age of Enlightenment and beyond intellectual developments were fuelled by excitement about what Ulrich Im Hof called "the grand opening-up of the wide world", especially of the interior of the non-European continents. This outward turn was complemented by a fascination with "the world within" as anthropology and ethnology focused on the humanity of the indigenous populations of far-away lands - an interest in human nature that suggested a way for Europeans to understand themselves, encapsulated in Gauguin's Tahitian rumination "What are we?" The essays in the first half of the book discuss first- or second-hand, physical or mental encounters with the exotic lands and populations beyond the supposed cradle of civilisation. The works of literature and documents of cultural life featured in these essays bear testimony to the crossing not only of geographical, ethnological, and cultural borders but also of borders of a variety of intellectual activities and interests. The second section examines the growing interest in astronomy and the engagement with imagined worlds in the universe, again with a view to understanding homo sapiens, as compared now to the extra-terrestrials that were confidently assumed to exist. The final group of essays focuses on the exploration of the landscape of what was called "the universe within"; featuring, among a variety of other texts, Schiller's plays The Maid of Orleans and William Tell, these essays observe and analyse what Erich Heller termed "The Artist's Journey into the Interior." This collection, which travels from the interior of continents to the interior of the mind, is itself a set of explorations that revel in the discovery of what was half-hidden in language. Written by a scholar of international repute, it is eye-opening reading for all those with an interest in the literary and cultural history of (and since) the Enlightenment."--Publisher's website. 0aAnthropologyzEuropexHistoryy18th century. 0aEthnographyzEuropey18th century. 0aEuropean literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aLiterature and society. 0aEnlightenment. 0aEuropexIntellectual lifey18th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0126zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0126.jpgzConnect to cover image03781nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024702200220027202200230029403500220031704000210033904300120036010000310037224501180040326400460052126400110056730000610057833600260063933700260066533800360069149000450072750000440077250600480081653800360086454001770090050400660107750502710114352012600141465000630267465000480273765000680278565000480285365000620290165000570296371000380302083000440305885600570310285600920315999100465407970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         180531t20182018enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783744794 (Hardback)  z9781783744787 (Paperback)  a9781783744800q(pdf)  a9781783744817q(epub)  a9781783744824q(mobi)  z9781783745272q(XML)  z2399-6668 (Print)  a2399-6676 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1043381167  aStSaULbengerda  ae-sz---1 aJossen, Marianne,eauthor.10aUndocumented migrants and healthcareh[electronic resource] :beight stories from Switzerland /cMarianne Jossen. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (116 pages) :b2 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen reports seriesx2399-6676 ;vvol. 6  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

How do they navigate the (often contradictory) challenges presented by bureaucratic systems, financial pressures, attitudes to migrants, and their own healthcare needs? This urgent study uses a grounded theory approach to explore the ways in which undocumented migrants are included in or excluded from healthcare in a Swiss region. Marianne Jossen explores the ways migrants try to obtain healthcare on their own, with the help of NGOs or via insurance, and how they cope if they fail, whether by using risky strategies to access healthcare or leaving serious health issues untreated. Jossen shows that even for those who succeed, inclusion remains partial and fraught with risks. Based on interviews with migrants, health practitioners and NGO staff and using a rigorous academic approach, Undocumented Migrants and Healthcare is an important contribution to a vital contemporary issue. It is necessary reading for researchers in Public Health and Migration Studies, as well as government and non-governmental organisations in Switzerland and beyond. It will be of interest to anyone concerned with healthcare and migration in the twenty-first century."--Publisher's website. 0aImmigrantszHealth and hygienezSwitzerlandvCase studies. 0aImmigrantsxGovernment policyzSwitzerland. 0aImmigrantsxHealth and hygienexGovernment policyzSwitzerland. 0aEmigration and immigrationxHealth aspects. 0aHealth services accessibilityzSwitzerlandvCase studies. 0aEqualityxHealth aspectszSwitzerlandvCase studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen reports series ;vv. 6.x2399-667640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0139zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0139.jpgzConnect to cover image04463nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031404100130033510000460034824000320039424501840042626400460061026400110065630000540066733600260072133700260074733800360077349000530080950000600086250000440092250600480096653800360101454001650105050001130121550400400132850501870136852017470155554600320330260000500333460000640338460000510344865100480349970000690354770000510361671000380366783000430370585600570374885600920380599100469290970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         180612t20182018enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783744473 (Hardback)  z9781783744466 (Paperback)  a9781783744480q(pdf)  a9781783744497q(epub)  a9781783744503q(mobi)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1091530265  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghger1 aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805,eauthor.10aDon Carlos.lEnglish.f201810aDon Carlos Infante of Spainh[electronic resource] :ba dramatic poem /cby Friedrich Schiller ; translation and notes to the text by Flora Kimmich ; introduction by John Guthrie. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (214 pages) :b7 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen Book classics seriesx2054-2178 ;vvol. 9    aEdition statement information from publisher's website.  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Characters ; Act One ; Act Two ; Act Three ; Act Four ; Act Five ; Notes.   a"Schiller's Don Carlos, written ten years before his great Wallenstein trilogy, testifies to the young playwright's growing power. First performed in 1787, it stands at the culmination of Schiller's formative development as a dramatist and is the first play written in his characteristic iambic pentameter. Don Carlos plunges the audience into the dangerous political and personal struggles that rupture the court of the Spanish King Philip II in 1658. The autocratic king's son Don Carlos is caught between his political ideals, fostered by his friendship with the charismatic Marquis Posa, and his doomed love for his stepmother Elisabeth of Valois. These twin passions set him against his father, the brooding and tormented Philip, and the terrible power of the Catholic Church, represented in the play by the indelible figure of the Grand Inquisitor. Schiller described Don Carlos as "a family portrait in a princely house." It interweaves political machinations with powerful personal relationships to create a complex and resonant tragedy. The conflict between absolutism and liberty appealed not only to audiences but also to other artists and gave rise to several operas, not least to Verdi's great Don Carlos of 1867. The play, which the playwright never finished to his satisfaction, lives on nonetheless among his best-loved works and is translated here with flair and skill by Flora Kimmich.

The Juggler of Notre Dame tells how an entertainer abandons the world to join a monastery, but is suspected of blasphemy after dancing his devotion before a statue of the Madonna in the crypt; he is saved when the statue, delighted by his skill, miraculously comes to life. Jan Ziolkowski tracks the poem from its medieval roots to its rediscovery in late nineteenth-century Paris, before its translation into English in Britain and the United States. The visual influence of the tale on Gothic revivalism and vice versa in America is carefully documented with lavish and inventive illustrations, and Ziolkowski concludes with an examination of the explosion of interest in The Juggler of Notre Dame in the twentieth century and its place in mass culture today. The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity is a rich case study for the reception of the Middle Ages in modernity. Spanning centuries and continents, the medieval period is understood through the lens of its (post)modern reception in Europe and America. Profound connections between the verbal and the visual are illustrated by a rich trove of images, including book illustrations, stained glass, postage stamps, architecture, and Christmas cards. Presented with great clarity and simplicity, Ziolkowski's work is accessible to the general reader, while its many new discoveries will be valuable to academics in such fields and disciplines as medieval studies, medievalism, philology, literary history, art history, folklore, performance studies, and reception studies."--Publisher's website.00aTombeor Nostre Dame.lFrench. 0aMedievalism. 0aCivilization, MedievalxInfluence. 0aMiddle AgesxHistoriography. 0aMiddle AgesxInfluence.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0132zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0132.jpgzConnect to cover image06042nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026910000320029024501400032226400460046226400110050830000340051933600260055333700260057933800360060550000440064150600480068553800360073354001070076954001650087650400920104150518990113352021200303260000460515260000760519865000380527465100450531270000400535771000380539785600570543585600920549299100471603970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         210612t20182018enk     sb    000 0 ger d  z9781783744428 (Hardback)  z9781783744411 (Paperback)  a9781783744435q(pdf)  a9781783744442q(epub)  a9781783744459q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1229883786  aStSaULbengerda1 aStegmaier, Werner,eauthor.10aEuropa im Geisterkriegh[electronic resource] :bStudien zu Nietzsche /cWerner Stegmaier ; herausgegeben von Andrea Christian Bertino. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (638 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  a"Dieses Werk ist lizensiert unter Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0)."  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Die Studien handeln von Grundfragen der Philosophie Nietzsches. Sie setzen ein (I) mit seiner Neubestimmung der Wahrheit und der Philosophie und (II) seiner Verzeitlichung des Denkens unter (III) Verzicht auf ,die Vernunft' bei der Bestimmung des Menschen, interpretieren von hier aus (IV) die Anti-Lehren von Nietzsches Zarathustra, umreißen (V) Nietzsches Ethik für ,gute Europäer' und schließen (VI) mit der Interpretation von Nietzsches Selbsteinschätzung als Schicksal der Philosophie und der Menschheit (Ecce homo, Warum ich ein Schicksal bin 1) und einer Einschätzung von Nietzsches Zukunft, die schon seit über einem Jahrhundert begonnen hat. Werner Stegmaier, Jahrgang 1946, war Gründungsdirektor des Instituts für Philosophie der Universität Greifswald nach dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion und baute das Nord- und osteuropäische Forum für Philosophie auf, das Institute für Philosophie rund um die Ostsee neu miteinander ins Gespräch brachte und dort zu philosophischen Neuorientierungen beitrug. Er hat auf vielfältigen Gebieten gearbeitet, unter anderem zur Metaphysik und ihrem Grundbegriff der Substanz, zu großen Philosophen von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart, zur philosophischen Aktualität der jüdischen Tradition, vor allem aber zur Philosophie Nietzsches. Dabei ging es ihm stets um Fragen der Ersten Philosophie, insbesondere die, was unsere Realität ausmacht, wie sie durch Zeichen und Kommunikation vermittelt wird, wie Begriffe in der Zeit existieren und womit man es beim Denken zu tun hat. Er führte den Begriff der Orientierung als elementaren Begriff der Philosophie ein und entwickelte eine umfassende Philosophie der Orientierung."--Publisher's website.10aNietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm,d1844-1900.10aNietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm,d1844-1900xCriticism and interpretation. 0aPhilosophy, Germany19th century. 0aEuropexIntellectual lifey19th century.1 aBertino, Andrea Christian,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0133zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0133.jpgzConnect to cover image04194nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000400031524501500035524600310050526400460053626400110058230000630059333600260065633700260068233800360070850000440074450600480078853800360083654001770087250400670104950502720111652019980138863000340338665000170342065000390343765000330347665000280350971000380353785600570357585600920363299100476274970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         180724t20182018enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783745074 (Hardback)  z9781783745067 (Paperback)  a9781783745081q(pdf)  a9781783745098q(epub)  a9781783745104q(mobi)  a9781783745715q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1049442140  aStSaULbengerda1 aZiolkowski, Jan M.,d1956-eauthor.14aThe juggler of Notre Dame and the medievalizing of modernityh[electronic resource].nVolume 2,pMedieval meets medievalism /cJan M.

Presented with great clarity and simplicity, Ziolkowski's work is accessible to the general reader, while its many new discoveries will be valuable to academics in such fields and disciplines as medieval studies, medievalism, philology, literary history, art history, folklore, performance studies, and reception studies."--Publisher's website.00aTombeor Nostre Dame.lFrench. 0aMedievalism. 0aCivilization, MedievalxInfluence. 0aMiddle AgesxHistoriography. 0aMiddle AgesxInfluence. 0aUnited StatesxCivilization. 0aUnited StatesxIntellectual life.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0146zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0146.jpgzConnect to cover image05726nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031410000370033524000430037224501490041524600390056424600410060326400470064426400110069130000590070233600260076133700260078733800360081349000460084950000440089550600480093953800360098754001770102350000990120050400440129950521250134352013510346854600420481960000420486170000740490371000380497783000430501585600570505885600930511599100503057970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         180907t20182018enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783745906 (Hardback)  z9781783745890 (Paperback)  a9781783745913q(pdf)  a9781783745920q(epub)  a9781783745937q(mobi)  z2054-2437 (Print)  a2054-2445 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1055162227  aStSaULbengerda1 aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.10aPhilippics.pBook 2.lEnglish & Latin 10aCicero, Philippic 2, 44-50, 78-92, 100-119h[electronic resource] :bLatin text, study aids with vocabulary, and commentary /cIngo Gildenhard. 30aPhilippic 2, 44-50, 78-92, 100-11930aPhilippic two, 44-50, 78-92, 100-119 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (viii, 480 pages) :b1 illustration.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 a[Classics textbooksx2054-2445 ;vvol. 6]  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

In the tumultuous aftermath of Caesar's death, Cicero and Mark Antony found themselves on opposing sides of an increasingly bitter and dangerous battle for control. Philippic 2 was a weapon in that war. Conceived as Cicero's response to a verbal attack from Antony in the Senate, Philippic 2 is a rhetorical firework that ranges from abusive references to Antony's supposedly sordid sex life to a sustained critique of what Cicero saw as Antony's tyrannical ambitions. Vituperatively brilliant and politically committed, it is both a carefully crafted literary artefact and an explosive example of crisis rhetoric. It ultimately led to Cicero's own gruesome death. This course book offers a portion of the original Latin text, vocabulary aids, study questions, and an extensive commentary. Designed to stretch and stimulate readers, Ingo Gildenhard's volume will be of particular interest to students of Latin studying for A-Level or on undergraduate courses. It extends beyond detailed linguistic analysis to encourage critical engagement with Cicero, his oratory, the politics of late-republican Rome, and the transhistorical import of Cicero's politics of verbal (and physical) violence.."--Publisher's website.     aChiefly in English ; some Latin text.10aCicero, Marcus Tullius.tPhilippicae.1 aGildenhard, Ingo,d1970-eeditor,etranslator,ewriter of commentary.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aClassics textbooks ;vv. 6.x2054-244540uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0156zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0156.jpgzConnect to cover image 04911nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404100130031510000490032824000260037724501920040325000270059526400470062226400110066930000550068033600260073533700260076133800360078750000440082350600480086753800360091554001770095150000820112850001700121050001450138050400720152550400400159750506600163752014740229754600320377160000400380365000480384365100460389165100540393770000610399170001060405271000380415885600570419685600920425399100508517970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         180917t20182018enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783745555 (Hardback)  z9781783745548 (Paperback)  a9781783745562q(pdf)  a9781783745579q(epub)  a9781783745586q(mobi)  a9781783746095q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1056070831  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghger1 aZur Mühlen, Hermynia,d1883-1951,eauthor.10aEnd and the beginning14aThe Red Countessh[electronic resource] :bselect autobiographical and fictional writing of Hermynia Zur Mühlen (1883-1951) /ctranslated, annotated and with an essay by Lionel Gossman.  aNew, expanded edition. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (452 pages) :b17 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Never comfortable with the traditional roles women were expected to play, she broke as a young adult both with her family and, after five years on his estate in the old Czarist Russia, with her German Junker husband, and set out as an independent, free-thinking individual, earning a precarious living as a writer. Zur Mühlen translated over 70 books from English, French and Russian into German, notably the novels of Upton Sinclair, which she turned into best-sellers in Germany; produced a series of detective novels under a pseudonym; wrote seven engaging and thought-provoking novels of her own, six of which were translated into English; contributed countless insightful short stories and articles to newspapers and magazines; and, having become a committed socialist, achieved international renown in the 1920s with her Fairy Tales for Workers' Children, which were widely translated including into Chinese and Japanese. Because of her fervent and outspoken opposition to National Socialism, she and her life-long Jewish partner, Stefan Klein, had to flee first Germany, where they had settled, and then, in 1938, her native Austria. They found refuge in England, where Zur Mühlen died, forgotten and virtually penniless, in 1951."--Publisher's website.  aTranslated from the German.10aZur Mühlen, Hermynia,d1883-1951. 0aAuthors, Austriany20th centuryvBiography. 0aAustriaxSocial conditionsy19th century. 0aEurope, CentralxSocial conditionsy20th century.1 aGossman, Lionel,etranslator,eeditor,ewriter of essay.1 iContainer of (expression):aZur Mühlen, Hermynia,d1883-1951.tEnde und Anfang.lEnglishs(Gossman)2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0140zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0140.jpgzConnect to cover image04234nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000280031524501630034326400460050626400110055230000550056333600260061833700260064433800360067050000440070650600480075053800360079854001770083450400530101150504320106452015910149661000190308765000390310665100370314565100370318265100630321965100650328265100660334765100630341365100650347671000380354185600570357985600920363699100508545970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         180907t20182018enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783744954 (Hardback)  z9781783744947 (Paperback)  a9781783744961q(pdf)  a9781783744978q(epub)  a9781783744985q(mobi)  z9781783746064q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1055161842  aStSaULbengerda1 aKelly, Andrew,eauthor.10aANZUS and the early Cold Warh[electronic resource] :bstrategy and diplomacy between Australia, New Zealand and the United States, 1945-1956 /cAndrew Kelly. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (216 pages) :b18 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Forged by influential individuals and impacting on global events including the Japanese Peace Treaty, the Korean War and the Suez Crisis, the ANZUS Alliance was a crucial factor in the seismic changes that took place in the second half of the twentieth century. In this compact and accessible study, Andrew Kelly lays out the tensions that underpinned the formation of the Alliance, as each power sought to extract maximum influence and prestige. He examines how the ANZUS powers worked together (or failed to do so) when responding to massive global events including the rise of the People's Republic of China and the waning of the British Empire. Kelly comprehensively explores the reasons why Australia and New Zealand disagreed so regularly about mutual security issues, how US global leadership shaped ANZUS, and the British impact on the trilateral relationship, and outlines how these issues set the foundations for today's world order. ANZUS and the Early Cold War is essential reading for historians of Australian, New Zealand and American international relations in the twentieth century. Its concise format and readable style will also appeal to general readers interested in the history and foreign policies of these nations, and to anyone who wants to know more about the individual and geopolitical tensions that beset any major alliance."--Publisher's website.20aANZUS Council. 0aAlliancesxHistoryy20th century.  0aPacific AreaxForeign relations. 0aPacific AreaxNational security. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationszAustraliay20th century. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationszNew Zealandy20th century. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationszPacific Areay20th century. 0aAustraliaxForeign relationszUnited Statesy20th century. 0aNew ZealandxForeign relationszUnited Statesy20th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0141zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0141.jpgzConnect to cover image04443nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000340031524501310034926400460048026400110052630000610053733600260059833700260062433800360065050000440068650600480073053800360077854001770081450400760099150507000106752017090176760000640347660000390354060000750357960000500365465000310370465000510373571000380378685600570382485600920388199100512178970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         181001t20182018enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783745128 (Hardback)  z9781783745111 (Paperback)  a9781783745135q(pdf)  a9781783745142q(epub)  a9781783745159q(mobi)  z9781783746217q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1056076780  aStSaULbengerda1 aKrementsov, Nikolai,eauthor.10aWith and without Galtonh[electronic resource] :bVasilii Florinskii and the fate of eugenics in Russia /cNikolai Krementsov. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (xxvi, 668 pages) :b49 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

The same year, Russian physician Vasilii Florinskii addressed similar issues in a sizeable treatise, entitled Human Perfection and Degeneration. Initially unheralded, Florinskii's book would go on to have a remarkable afterlife in twentieth- and twenty-first-century Russia. In this lucid and insightful work, Nikolai Krementsov argues that the concept of eugenics brings together ideas, values, practices, and fears energised by a focus on the future. It has proven so seductive to different groups over time because it provides a way to grapple with fundamental existential questions of human nature and destiny. With and Without Galton develops this argument by tracing the life-story of Florinskii's monograph from its uncelebrated arrival amid the Russian empire's Great Reforms, to its reissue after the Bolshevik Revolution, its decline under Stalinism, and its subsequent resurgence: first, as a founding document of medical genetics, and most recently, as a manifesto for nationalists and racial purists. Krementsov's meticulously researched 'biography of a book' sheds light not only on the peculiar fate of eugenics in Russia, but also on its convoluted transnational history, elucidating the field's protean nature and its continuing and contested appeal to diverse audiences, multiple local trajectories, and global trends.

The Juggler of Notre Dame tells how an entertainer abandons the world to join a monastery, but is suspected of blasphemy after dancing his devotion before a statue of the Madonna in the crypt; he is saved when the statue, delighted by his skill, miraculously comes to life. Jan Ziolkowski tracks the poem from its medieval roots to its rediscovery in late nineteenth-century Paris, before its translation into English in Britain and the United States. The visual influence of the tale on Gothic revivalism and vice versa in America is carefully documented with lavish and inventive illustrations, and Ziolkowski concludes with an examination of the explosion of interest in The Juggler of Notre Dame in the twentieth century and its place in mass culture today. Volume 4 examines the famous Le jongleur de Notre Dame by the French composer Jules Massenet, which took Europe by storm after premiering in 1902 and then crossed the Atlantic to the impresario Oscar Hammerstein and the diva Mary Garden, who gave the opera new legs as a female juggler. Presented with great clarity and simplicity, Ziolkowski's work is accessible to the general reader, while its many new discoveries will be valuable to academics in such fields and disciplines as medieval studies, medievalism, philology, literary history, art history, folklore, performance studies, and reception studies."--Publisher's website.00aTombeor Nostre Dame.lFrench.10aGarden, Mary,d1874-1967. 0aOperaxHistoryy19th century. 0aMedievalism. 0aCivilization, MedievalxInfluence. 0aMiddle AgesxHistoriography. 0aMiddle AgesxInfluence.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0147zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0147.jpgzConnect to cover image03879nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000290031524501210034426400460046526400110051130000390052233600260056133700260058733800360061350000440064950600480069353800360074154001640077750400510094150506980099252015350169065000210322565000230324671000380326985600570330785600930336499100518733970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         181015t20182018enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783745814 (Hardback)  z9781783745807 (Paperback)  a9781783745821q(pdf)  a9781783745838q(epub)  a9781783745845q(mobi)  z9781783746088q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1082988925  aStSaULbengerda1 aNettle, Daniel,eauthor.10aHanging on to the edgesh[electronic resource] :bessays on science, society and the academic life /cDaniel Nettle. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (vi, 257 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).For more detailed information consult the publisher's website.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction -- PART ONE. 1.

Scientists often overstate their claim to certainty, sorting the world into categorical distinctions that obstruct rather than clarify its complexities. In this book Daniel Nettle urges the reader to unpick such distinctions-biological versus social sciences, mind versus body, and nature versus nurture-and look instead for the for puzzles and anomalies, the points of connection and overlap. These essays, converted from often humorous, sometimes autobiographical blog posts, form an extended meditation on the possibilities and frustrations of the life scientific. Pragmatically arguing from the intersection between social and biological sciences, Nettle reappraises the virtues of policy initiatives such as Universal Basic Income and income redistribution, highlighting the traps researchers and politicians are liable to encounter. This provocative, intelligent and self-critical volume is a testament to the possibilities of interdisciplinary study-whose virtues Nettle stridently defends-drawing from and having implications for a wide cross-section of academic inquiry. This will appeal to anybody curious about the implications of social and biological sciences for increasingly topical political concerns. It comes particularly recommended to Sciences and Social Sciences students and to scholars seeking to extend the scope of their field in collaboration with other disciplines.

Sharp was a Scottish poet, novelist, biographer and editor who in 1893 began to write critically and commercially successful books under the name Fiona Macleod. This was far more than just a pseudonym: he corresponded as Macleod, enlisting his sister to provide the handwriting and address, and for more than a decade "Fiona Macleod" duped not only the general public but such literary luminaries as William Butler Yeats and, in America, E. C. Stedman. Sharp wrote "I feel another self within me now more than ever; it is as if I were possessed by a spirit who must speak out". This three-volume collection brings together Sharp's own correspondence - a fascinating trove in its own right, by a Victorian man of letters who was on intimate terms with writers including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Walter Pater, and George Meredith - and the Fiona Macleod letters, which bring to life Sharp's intriguing "second self". With an introduction and detailed notes by William F. Halloran, this richly rewarding collection offers a wonderful insight into the literary landscape of the time, while also investigating a strange and underappreciated phenomenon of late-nineteenth-century English literature. It is essential for scholars of the period, and it is an illuminating read for anyone interested in authorship and identity."--Publisher's website.10aSharp, William,d1855-1905.1 aHalloran, William F.,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0142zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0142.jpgzConnect to cover image04407nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000320011102000330014302000250017602000260020102000260022702000250025302200220027802200230030003500220032304000210034504100130036610000210037924000320040024502030043224600360063524600560067126400470072726400110077430000550078533600260084033700260086633800360089249000440092850000440097250600480101653800360106454001770110050400430127750502430132052017290156354600250329260000310331765000480334865000470339670000890344370000790353271000380361183000430364985600570369285600920374999100540165970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         190226t20182018enka    sb    000   eng d  a9781783746019 z (Hardback)  a9781783746002 z (Paperback)  a9781783746026q(pdf)  a9781783746033q(epub)  a9781783746040q(mobi)  a9781783746057q(XML)  z2054-2437 (Print)  a2054-2445 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1117870253  aStSaULbengerda0 aengalat0 aVirgil,eauthor.10aAeneis.nLiber 11.lEnglish10aVirgil, Aeneid, 11 (Pallas & Camilla), 1-224, 498-521, 532-96, 648-89, 725-835h[electronic resource] :bLatin text, study aids with vocabulary, and commentary /cIngo Gildenhard and John Henderson.30aAeneid, 11 (Pallas and Camilla)30aAeneid, 11, 1-224, 498-521, 532-96, 648-89, 725-835 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (596 pages) :b17 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aClassics textbooksx2054-2445 ;vvol. 7  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Following the savage slaughter in Aeneid 10, the book opens in a mournful mood as the warring parties revisit yesterday's killing fields to attend to their dead. One casualty in particular commands attention: Aeneas' protégé Pallas, killed and despoiled by Turnus in the previous book. His death plunges his father Evander and his surrogate father Aeneas into heart-rending despair - and helps set up the foundational act of sacrificial brutality that caps the poem, when Aeneas seeks to avenge Pallas by slaying Turnus in wrathful fury. Turnus' departure from the living is prefigured by that of his ally Camilla, a maiden schooled in the martial arts, who sets the mold for warrior princesses such as Xena and Wonder Woman. In the final third of Aeneid 11, she wreaks havoc not just on the battlefield but on gender stereotypes and the conventions of the epic genre, before she too succumbs to a premature death. In the portions of the book selected for discussion here, Virgil offers some of his most emotive (and disturbing) meditations on the tragic nature of human existence - but also knows how to lighten the mood with a bit of drag. This course book offers the original Latin text, vocabulary aids, study questions, and an extensive commentary. Designed to stretch and stimulate readers, Ingo Gildenhard's volume will be of particular interest to students of Latin studying for A-Level or on undergraduate courses. It extends beyond detailed linguistic analysis to encourage critical engagement with Virgil's poetry and the most recent scholarly thought."--Publisher's website.  aIncludes Latin text.00aVirgil.tAeneis.nLiber 4. 0aAeneas (Legendary character) in literature. 0aEpic poetry, LatinxHistory and criticism.1 aGildenhard, Ingo,d1970-ewriter of commentary,ewriter of supplementary material.  1 aHenderson, John,ewriter of commentary,ewriter of supplementary material.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aClassics textbooks ;vv. 7.x2054-244540uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0158zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0158.jpgzConnect to cover image04900nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000400031524501550035524600360051026400460054626400110059230000630060333600260066633700260069233800360071850000440075450600480079853800360084654001770088250400530105950510930111252017280220563000340393365000170396765000390398465000590402365000620408265000280414465100470417271000380421985600570425785600920431499100540201970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         190226t20182018enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783745401 (Hardback)  z9781783745395 (Paperback)  a9781783745418q(pdf)  a9781783745425q(epub)  a9781783745432q(mobi)  a9781783745746q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1096219739  aStSaULbengerda1 aZiolkowski, Jan M.,d1956-eauthor.14aThe juggler of Notre Dame and the medievalizing of modernityh[electronic resource].nVolume 6,pWar and peace, sex and violence /cJan M.

The Juggler of Notre Dame tells how an entertainer abandons the world to join a monastery, but is suspected of blasphemy after dancing his devotion before a statue of the Madonna in the crypt; he is saved when the statue, delighted by his skill, miraculously comes to life. Jan Ziolkowski tracks the poem from its medieval roots to its rediscovery in late nineteenth-century Paris, before its translation into English in Britain and the United States. The visual influence of the tale on Gothic revivalism and vice versa in America is carefully documented with lavish and inventive illustrations, and Ziolkowski concludes with an examination of the explosion of interest in The Juggler of Notre Dame in the twentieth century and its place in mass culture today. In this concluding volume, Ziolkowski explores the popularity of The Juggler of Notre Dame from the 1930s through the Second World War, especially in the Allied Resistance. Its popularity in the United States was subsequently maintained by figures as diverse as Tony Curtis and W. H. Auden, and although recently the story and medievalism have lost ground, the future of both holds promise. Presented with great clarity and simplicity, Ziolkowski's work is accessible to the general reader, while its many new discoveries will be valuable to academics in such fields and disciplines as medieval studies, medievalism, philology, literary history, art history, folklore, performance studies, and reception studies."--Publisher's website.00aTombeor Nostre Dame.lFrench. 0aMedievalism. 0aCivilization, MedievalxInfluence. 0aPerforming artszUnited StatesxHistoryy20th century. 0aAmerican literaturexHistory and criticismy20th century. 0aMiddle AgesxInfluence. 0aUnited StatesxCivilizationy20th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0149zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0149.jpgzConnect to cover image03829nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404300120031510000280032724501190035526400460047426400110052030000630053133600260059433700260062033800360064650000440068250600480072653800360077454001770081050400530098750505340104052014600157465000640303465000470309865000500314571000380319585600570323385600930329099100540225970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         190226t20182018enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783745609 (Hardback)  z9781783745593 (Paperback)  a9781783745616q(pdf)  a9781783745623q(epub)  a9781783745630q(mobi)  a9781783746545q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1084344387  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk---1 aHobbs, Andrew,eauthor.12aA Fleet Street in every townh[electronic resource] :bthe provincial press in England, 1855-1900 /cAndrew Hobbs. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2018. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (478 pages) :b64 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

More popular than books, more widely read than the London papers, the local press was a national phenomenon. This book redraws the Victorian cultural map, shifting our focus away from one centre, London, and towards the many centres of the provinces. It offers a new paradigm in which place, and a sense of place, are vital to the histories of the newspaper, reading and publishing. Hobbs offers new perspectives on the nineteenth century from an enormous yet neglected body of literature: the hundreds of local newspapers published and read across England. He reveals the people, processes and networks behind the publishing, maintaining a unique focus on readers and what they did with the local paper as individuals, families and communities. Case studies and an unusual mix of quantitative and qualitative evidence show that the vast majority of readers preferred the local paper, because it was about them and the places they loved. A Fleet Street in Every Town positions the local paper at the centre of debates on Victorian newspapers, periodicals, reading and publishing. It reorientates our view of the Victorian press away from metropolitan high culture and parliamentary politics, and towards the places where most people lived, loved and read. This is an essential book for anybody interested in nineteenth-century print culture, journalism and reading."--Publisher's website. 0aJournailsm, RegionalzGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century. 0aBritish newspapersxHistoryy19th century. 0aNewspaper publishingzGreat BritainxHistory.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0152zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0152.jpgzConnect to cover image 03770nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200230024702200230027003500220029304000210031504300120033610000290034824501480037726400460052526400110057130000630058233600260064533700260067133800360069749000430073350000440077650600480082053800360086854001650090450507980106952010890186765000540295665000300301065000280304071000380306883000440310685600570315085600930320799100540244970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         190226t20192019enka    s     000 0 eng d  z9781783745968 (Hardback)  z9781783745951 (Paperback)  a9781783745975q(pdf)  a9781783745982q(epub)  a9781783745999q(mobi)  z2399-6668 (Print)   a2399-6676 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1100520044  aStSaULbengerda  ae-us---1 aSukhwant, Jhaj,eauthor.10aDelivering on the promise of democracyh[electronic resource] :bvisual case studies in educational equity and transformation /cSukhwant Jhaj. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2019. 4c©2019  a1 online resource (478 pages) :b64 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen reports seriesx2399-6676vvol. 7  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Sukhwant Jhaj has crafted a refreshing new look at how imaginative leadership and a shift in perspective can propel institutions to reach at-risk or underrepresented members of their communities. Delivering on the Promise of Democracy pulls back the curtain on seven high-performing universities to reveal which daily decisions, including listening to the community, embracing conflict, and implementing effective strategies through routine, guide administrators in achieving exceptional results. Through in-depth interviews that offer a close look at these seven universities, Jhaj traces a new trajectory for higher education: a call to question a university's effectiveness through its accessibility to the community it serves.  Jhaj's book will inspire anybody interested in widening access to education with its call to renew their institution's mission through powerful and effective leadership."--Publisher's website. 0aEducation, HigherxAdministrationzUnited States. 0aEducational equalization. 0aEducational leadership.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen reports series ;vv. 7.x2399-667640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0157zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0157.jpgzConnect to cover image 04178nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404300120031524501540032724600560048126400460053726400110058330000630059433600260065733700260068333800360070950000440074550600480078953800360083754001650087350509650103852013390200365000230334265000150336565000190338070000560339970000340345570000310348971000380352085600570355885600930361599100540910970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         190228t20192019enka    s     000 0 eng d  z9781783745456 (Hardback)  z9781783745449 (Paperback)  a9781783745463q(pdf)  a9781783745470q(epub)  a9781783745487q(mobi)  a9781783746859q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1090023286  aStSaULbengerda  ae-ru---00aLife histories of "etnos" theory in Russia and beyondh[electronic resource] /cedited by David G.

In the twentieth century, the concept came to be associated with Soviet state-building, and it fell sharply out of favour. Yet outside the academy, etnos-style arguments not only persist, but are a vibrant part of regional anthropological traditions. Life Histories of Etnos Theory in Russia and Beyond makes a powerful argument for reconsidering the importance of etnos in our understanding of ethnicity and national identity across Eurasia. The collection brings to life a rich archive of previously unpublished letters, fieldnotes, and photographic collections of the theory's early proponents. Using contemporary fieldwork and case studies, the volume shows how the ideas of these ethnographers continue to impact and shape identities in various regional theatres from Ukraine to the Russian North to the Manchurian steppes of what is now China. Through writing a life history of these collectivist concepts, the contributors to this volume unveil a world where the assumptions of liberal individualism do not hold. In doing so, they demonstrate how notions of belonging are not fleeting but persistent, multi-generational, and bio-social."--Publisher's website. 0aEthnologyzRussia. 0aEthnology. 0aEthnic groups.1 aAnderson, David G.q(David George),d1965-eeditor.1 aArzyutov, Dmitry V.,eeditor.1 aAlymov, Sergeǐ,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0150zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0150.jpgzConnect to cover image 03593nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024702200220027202200230029403500220031704000210033904100180036010000490037824000300042724501430045726400460060026400110064630000440065733600260070133700260072733800360075349000520078950000440084150600480088553800360093354001770096954600370114650502180118352012650140160000700266660000510273670000690278771000380285683000440289485600570293885600920299599100541510970896620251031161551.0m        d        cr##n#########190305t20192019enkb    s     000 0 eng d  z9781783746569 (Hardback)  z9781783746552 (Paperback)  a9781783746576q(pdf)  a9781783746583q(epub)  a9781783746590q(mobi)  a9781783746675q(XML)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1089990788  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghgeraeng1 aHölderlin, Friedrich,d1770-1843,eauthor.10aHyperion.lEnglish.f201910aHyperion, or the hermit in Greeceh[electronic resource] /cby Friedrich Hölderlin ; translated and with an afterword by Howard Gaskill. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2019. 4c©2019  a1 online resource (234 pages) :b1 map.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen Book classics seriesx2054-2178 ;vvol. 10  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Returning to Greece after German exile, following his part in the abortive uprising against the occupying Turks (1770), and his failure as both a lover and a revolutionary, Hyperion assumes a hermitic existence, during which he writes his letters. Confronting and commenting on his own past, with all its joy and grief, the narrator undergoes a transformation that culminates in the realisation of his true vocation.  Though Hölderlin is now established as a great lyric poet, recognition of his novel as a supreme achievement of European Romanticism has been belated in the Anglophone world. Incorporating the aesthetic evangelism that is a characteristic feature of the age, Hyperion preaches a message of redemption through beauty. The resolution of the contradictions and antinomies raised in the novel is found in the act of articulation itself. To a degree remarkable in a prose work of any length, what it means is inseparable from how it means. In this skilful translation, Gaskill conveys the beautiful music and rhythms of Hölderlin's language to an English-speaking reader."--Publisher's website.10aHölderlin, Friedrich,d1770-1843xCriticism and interpretation.10aHölderlin, Friedrich,d1770-1843.tHyperion.1 aGaskill, Howard,etranslator,ewriter of afterword,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen Book classics ;vv. 10.x2054-217840uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0160zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0160.jpgzConnect to cover image07026nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501470031526400460046226400110050830000640051933600260058333700260060933800360063550000440067150600480071553800360076354001650079950542430096452009720520765000220617965000190620165000270622065000320624770000370627970000290631670000350634571000380638085600570641885600930647599100542945970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         190226t20192019enka    s     000 0 eng d  z9781783745661 (Hardback)  z9781783745654 (Paperback)  a9781783745678q(pdf)  a9781783745685q(epub)  a9781783745692q(mobi)  a9781783746743q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1090549391  aStSaULbengerda00aWomen and migrationh[electronic resource] :bresponses in art and history /cedited by Deborah Willis, Ellyn Toscano and Kalia Brooks Nelson. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2019. 4c©2019  a1 online resource (670 pages) :b156 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

As a whole, the volume gives an impression of a wide range of migratory events from women's perspectives, covering the Caribbean Diaspora, refugees and slavery through the various lenses of politics and war, love and family. The contributors, which include academics and artists, offer both personal and critical points of view on the artistic and historical repositories of these experiences. Selfies, motherhood, violence and Hollywood all feature in this substantial treasure-trove of women's joy and suffering, disaster and delight, place, memory and identity. This collection appeals to artists and scholars of the humanities, particularly within the social sciences; though there is much to recommend it to creatives seeking inspiration or counsel on the issue of migratory experiences."--Publisher's website. 0aWomen immigrants. 0aWomen artists. 0aFeminism and the arts. 0aEmigration and immigration.1 aWillis, Deborah,d1948-eeditor.1 aToscano, Ellyn,eeditor.1 aNelson, Kalia Brooks,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0153zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0153.jpgzConnect to cover image 05539nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501640031526400560047926400110053530000630054633600260060933700260063533800360066150000440069750600480074153800360078954001650082550000200099050526010101052010550361165000150466665000160468165000310469765000300472865000280475870000310478670000280481771000380484571000240488385600570490785600930496499100544018970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         190314t20192019enka    s     001 0 eng d  z9781783746491 (Hardback)  z9781783746484 (Paperback)  a9781783746507q(pdf)  a9781783746514q(epub)  a9781783746521q(mobi)  a9781783746538q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1099616554  aStSaULbengerda00aWhose book is it anyway?h[electronic resource] :ba view from elsewhere on publishing, copyright and creativity /cedited by Janis Jefferies and Sarah Kember. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers :bCREATe,c2019. 4c©2019  a1 online resource (460 pages) :b21 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

It includes views - such as artist's perspectives, writer's perspectives, feminist, and international perspectives - that are too often marginalized or elided altogether. The diverse range of contributors take various approaches, from the scholarly and the essayistic to the graphic, to explore the future of publishing based on their experiences as publishers, artists, writers and academics. Considering issues such as intellectual property, copyright and comics, digital publishing and remixing, and what it means (not) to say one is an author, these vibrant essays urge us to view central aspects of writing and publishing in a new light. Whose Book is it Anyway? is a timely and varied collection of essays. It asks us to reconceive our understanding of publishing, copyright and open access, and it is essential reading for anyone invested in the future of publishing."--Publisher's website. 0aCopyright. 0aAuthorship. 0aPublishers and publishing. 0aCopyright, International. 0aOpen access publishing.1 aJefferies, Janis,eeditor.1 aKember, Sarah,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.2 aCREATe,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0159zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0159.jpgzConnect to cover image 06708nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501410031526400460045626400110050230000630051333600260057633600330060233700260063533800360066150000440069750600480074153800360078954001650082550004010099050400430139150529690143452011540440365000320555765000360558965000410562565000380566665000380570465000320574265000360577470000360581070000350584671000380588171101100591985600570602985600920608699100549582970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         190404t20192019enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783745500 (Hardback)  z9781783745494 (Paperback)  a9781783745517q(pdf)  a9781783745524q(epub)  a9781783745531q(mobi)  a9781783747238q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1102604113  aStSaULbengerda00aFrom darkness to lighth[electronic resource] :bwriters in museums 1798-1898 /cedited by Rosella Mamoli Zorzi and Katherine Manthorne. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2019. 4c©2019  a1 online resource (394 pages) :b44 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Written by an array of international experts, these collected essays gather perspectives from a diverse range of cultural sensibilities. From sensitive discussions of Tintoretto's unique approach to the play of light and darkness as exhibited in the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in Venice, to the development of museum lighting as part of Japanese artistic self-fashioning, via the story of an epic American painting on tour, museum illumination in the work of Henry James, and lighting alterations at Chatsworth (to name only a few topics) this book is a treasure trove of illuminating contributions. The collection is at once a refreshing insight for the enthusiastic museum-goer, who is brought to an awareness of the exhibit in its immediate environment, and a wide-ranging scholarly compendium for the professional who seeks to proceed in their academic or curatorial work with a more enlightened sense of the lighted space."--Publisher's website. 0aMuseumsxLightingxHistory. 0aArt museumsxLightingxHistory. 0aArtxExhibition techniquesxHistory. 0aAuthorsy18th centuryxAttitudes. 0aAuthorsy19th centuryxAttitudes. 0aMuseum visitorsxAttitudes. 0aArt museum visitorsxAttitudes.1 aMamoli Zorzi, Rosella,eeditor.1 aManthorne, Katherine,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.2 aInternational Conference "From darkness to light : writers in museusm 1798-1898"d(2016 :cVenice, Italy)40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0151zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0151.jpgzConnect to cover image09468nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000290031524500860034426400460043026400110047630000340048733600260052133600330054733700260058033800360060650000440064250600480068653800360073454001650077050000220093550003730095750551390133052019890646960000710845860000820852960000700861170000700868171000380875174000470878985600570883685600930889399100557320970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         190429t20192019enk     s     001 0 eng d  z9781783746620 (Hardback)  z9781783746613 (Paperback)  a9781783746637q(pdf)  a9781783746644q(epub)  a9781783746651q(mobi)  a9781783746668q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1101790595  aStSaULbengerda1 aWinnick, R.

H. Winnick identifies more than a thousand previously unknown instances in which Tennyson phrases of two or three to as many as several words are similar or identical to those occurring in prior works by other hands-discoveries aided by the proliferation of digitized texts and the related development of powerful search tools over the three decades since the most recent major edition of Tennyson's poems was published. Each of these instances may be deemed an allusion (meant to be recognized as such and pointing, for definable purposes, to a particular antecedent text), an echo (conscious or not, deliberate or not, meant to be noticed or not, meaningful or not), or merely accidental. Unless accidental, Winnick writes, these new textual parallels significantly expand our knowledge both of Tennyson's reading and of his thematic intentions and artistic technique. Coupled with the thousand-plus textual parallels previously reported by Christopher Ricks and other scholars, he says, they suggest that a fundamental and lifelong aspect of Tennyson's art was his habit of echoing any work, ancient or modern, which had the potential to enhance the resonance or deepen the meaning of his poems. The new textual parallels Winnick has identified point most often to the King James Bible and to such canonical authors as Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Thomson, Cowper, Shelley, Byron, and Wordsworth. But they also point to many authors rarely if ever previously cited in Tennyson editions and studies, including Michael Drayton, Richard Blackmore, Isaac Watts, Erasmus Darwin, John Ogilvie, Anna Lætitia Barbauld, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, John Wilson, and-with surprising frequency-Felicia Hemans. Tennyson's Poems: New Textual Parallels is thus a major new resource for Tennyson scholars and students, an indispensable adjunct to the 1987 edition of Tennyson's complete poems edited by Christopher Ricks."--Publisher's website.10aTennyson, Alfred Tennyson,cBaron,d1809-1892xCriticism, Textual.10aTennyson, Alfred Tennyson,cBaron,d1809-1892xCriticism and interpretation. 10aRicks, Christopher,d1933-tPoems of Tennyson : in three volumes.12aRicks, Christopher,d1933-tPoems of Tennyson : in three volumes.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.4 aThe poems of Tennyson : in three volumes. 40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0161zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0161.jpgzConnect to cover image 06022nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501150031526400460043026400110047630000660048733600260055333600360057933600330061533700260064833800360067450000440071050600480075453800360080254001650083850000350100350400550103850524290109352015690352265000440509165000230513565000320515865000320519065000380522265000380526070000300529871000380532885600570536685600930542399100559096970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         190507t20192019enkag   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783747276 (Hardback)  z9781783747269 (Paperback)  a9781783747283q(pdf)  a9781783747290q(epub)  a9781783747306q(mobi)  a9781783747313q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1101027115  aStSaULbengerda00aAnnunciationsh[electronic resource] :bsacred music for the twenty-first century /cedited by George Corbett. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2019. 4c©2019  a1 online resource (394 pages) :bcolour illustrations, music.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  anotated musicbntm2rdacontent   astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This makes it ever more urgent for theologians to explore the resources of art for enriching our understanding and experience of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Annunciations: Sacred Music for the twenty-First Century, edited by George Corbett, answers this need, evaluating the relationship between the sacred and the composition, performance, and appreciation of music. Through the theme of 'annunciations', this volume interrogates how, when, why, through and to whom God communicates in the Old and New Testaments. In doing so, it tackles the intimate relationship between Scriptural reflection and musical practice in the past, its present condition, and what the future might hold. Annunciations comprises three parts. Part I sets out flexible theological and compositional frameworks for a constructive relationship between the sacred and music. Part II presents the reflections of theologians and composers involved in collaborating on new pieces of sacred choral music, alongside the six new scores and links to the recordings. Part III considers the reality of programming and performing sacred works today. This volume provides an indispensable resource for scholars and artists working at the interface between theology and the arts, and for those involved in sacred music.

Act One ; Act Two ; Act Three ; Act Four ; Act Five -- Notes.  a"Schiller's play Kabale und Liebe, usually translated into English as Love and Intrigue, represents the disastrous consequences that follow when social constraint, youthful passion, and ruthless scheming collide in a narrow setting. Written between 1782 and 1784, the play bears the marks of life at the court of the despotic Duke of Württemberg, from which Schiller had just fled, and of a fraught liaison he entered shortly after his flight. It tells the tale of a love affair that crosses the boundaries of class, between a fiery and rebellious young nobleman and the beautiful and dutiful daughter of a musician. Their affair becomes entangled in the competing purposes of malign and not-so-malign figures present at an obscure and sordid princely court somewhere in Germany. It all leads to a climactic murder-suicide. Love and Intrigue, the third of Schiller's canonical plays (after The Robbers and Fiesco's Conspiracy at Genoa), belongs to the genre of domestic tragedy, with a small cast and an action indoors. It takes place as the highly conventional world of the late eighteenth century stands poised to erupt, and these tensions pervade its setting and emerge in its action. This lively play brims with comedy and tragedy expressed in a colorful, highly colloquial, sometimes scandalous prose well captured in Flora Kimmich's skilled and informed translation. An authoritative essay by Roger Paulin introduces the reader to the play. As with all books in the Open Book Classics series, this translation is supported by an introduction and notes that situate an old text in its period and help both the student and the general reader read it with ease and with pleasure."--Publisher's website.  aTranslated from the German.10aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805.tKabale und Liebe.10aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805vTranslations into English. 0aGerman drama (Tragedy) 0aGerman dramay18th century. 0aWomenzGermanyvDrama. 0aFamilyzGermanyvDrama. 0aMiddle class in literature. 0aLiterature and societyzGermanyxHistory.1 aKimmich, Flora,d1939-etranslator,ewriter of added commentary.1 aPaulin, Roger,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen Book classics ;vv. 11.x2054-217840uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0175zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0175.jpgzConnect to cover image03828nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020804000210023104100130025204300130026510000820027824501290036026400470048926400110053630000370054733600260058433700260061033800360063649000670067250000440073950600480078353800360083154001830086750000700105050000920112050400670121254600510127950500350133052013150136560000910268065000490277165000510282065000600287170000490293171000750298071000380305583000560309385600570314985600920320699100568002970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         220812t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800647268 (hbk.)  z9781800647251 (pbk.)  a9781800647275q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaheb  aa-iq--- 0 aJedaiah ben Abraham Bedersi,dapproximately 1270-approximately 1340,eauthor.10aSefer ha-Pardes by Jedaiah ha-Peninih[electronic resource] :ba critical edition with English translation /cDavid Torollo. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2022] 4c©2022  a1 online resource (x, 174 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 13  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

It is purportedly an example of musar: a compilation of wise epigrams and meshalim [parables] that teach moral lessons on different topics, such as the service of God, friendship, the deceitfulness of the world, medicine, logic, music, magic, and poetry. However, it is in reality a compendium of sayings that reveal the author's personal views and feelings on a variety of religious topics, secular sciences, and their practitioners. David Torollo presents a fluent and illuminating English-Hebrew parallel text based on four sixteenth-century witnesses: three manuscripts and a printed edition. A rigorous study accompanies and contextualises the Hebrew work, exploring Sefer ha-Pardes's transmission and reception in different places over time; its structure and content; its place in the intellectual environment and literary tradition of Provence; and possible lines of enquiry for future research. This essential new work offers a significant contribution to scholarship in the field of Medieval Hebrew Hispano-Provencal literature."--Publisher's website. 00aJedaiah ben Abraham Bedersi,dapproximately 1270-approximately 1340.tSefer ha-Pardes. 0aHebrew language, MedievalzFrancezProvence. 0aHebrew literature, MedievalzFrancezProvence. 0aHebrew literature, MedievalvTranslations into English.1 aTorollo, David,d1984-etranslator,eeditor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 13.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0299zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0299.jpgzConnect to cover image04123nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404100180031510000420033324000360037524501550041126400460056626400110061230000800062333600260070333700260072933800360075550000440079150600480083553800360088354001650091950001360108450401190122050505630133954600380190252013690194065000190330965000240332865100450335270000450339771000380344285600570348085600920353799100569550970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         190611t20192019enkabh  sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783747450 (Hardback)  z9781783747443 (Paperback)  a9781783747467q(pdf)  a9781783747474q(epub)  a9781783747481q(mobi)  a9781783747498q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1117487771  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghyidgeng1 aShṭif, Naḥum, 1879-1933,eauthor.10aPogromen in Uḳraine.lEnglish14aThe pogroms in Ukraine, 1918-19h[electronic resource] :bprelude to the Holocaust /cby Nokhem Shtif ; translated and introduced by Maurice Wolfthal. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2019. 4c©2019  a1 online resource (118 pages) :b1 illustration, 1 colour facsimile, 1 map.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Hundreds of Jewish communities were burned to the ground and hundreds of thousands of people were left homeless and destitute, including orphaned children. A number of groups were responsible for these brutal attacks, including the Volunteer Army, a faction of the Russian White Army. The Pogroms in Ukraine, 1918-19: Prelude to the Holocaust is a vivid and horrifying account of the atrocities committed by the Volunteer Army, written by Nokhem Shtif, an eminent Yiddish linguist and social activist who joined the relief efforts on behalf of the pogrom survivors in Kiev. Shtif's testimony, published in 1923, was born from his encounters there and from the weighty archive of documentation amassed by the relief workers. This was one of the earliest efforts to systematically record human rights atrocities on a mass scale. Originally written in Yiddish and here skillfully translated and introduced by Maurice Wolfthal, The Pogroms in Ukraine, 1918-19 brings to light a terrible and historically neglected series of persecutions that foreshadowed the Holocaust by twenty years. It is essential reading for academics and students in the fields of human rights, Jewish studies, Russian and Soviet studies, and Ukraine studies."--Publisher's website. 0aJewszUkraine. 0aJewsxPersecutions. 0aUkrainexHistoryyRevolution, 1917-1921.1 aWolfthal, Maurice,etranslator,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0176zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0176.jpgzConnect to cover image06141nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002200220019502200230021703500220024004000210026210000330028324501250031626400470044126400110048830000340049933600260053333700260055933800360058549000510062150000440067250600480071653800360076454001650080050529460096552015070391165000170541870000450543571000380548083000510551885600580556985600920562799100570982970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         190617t20192019enk     s     000 0 eng d  a9781783747009 (Hardback)  a9781783746996 (Paperback)  a9781783747016q(pdf)  z2397-1126 (Print)  a2397-1134 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1107450146  aStSaULbengerda1 aBorovik, Alexandre,eauthor.14aThe essence of mathematicsh[electronic resource] :bthrough elementary problems /cAlexandre Borovik and Tony Gardiner. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (389 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOBP series in mathematicsx2387-1134 ;vvol. 3  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Therefore it would benefit students and educated adults to understand what makes mathematics itself 'tick', and to appreciate why its shapes, patterns and formulae provide us with precisely the language we need to make sense of the world around us. The second part of this challenge may require some specialist experience, but the authors of this book concentrate on the first part, and explore the extent to which elementary mathematics allows us all to understand something of the nature of mathematics from the inside. The Essence of Mathematics consists of a sequence of 270 problems - with commentary and full solutions. The reader is assumed to have a reasonable grasp of school mathematics. More importantly, s/he should want to understand something of mathematics beyond the classroom, and be willing to engage with (and to reflect upon) challenging problems that highlight the essence of the discipline. The book consists of six chapters of increasing sophistication (Mental Skills; Arithmetic; Word Problems; Algebra; Geometry; Infinity), with interleaved commentary. The content will appeal to students considering further study of mathematics at university, teachers of mathematics at age 14-18, and anyone who wants to see what this kind of elementary content has to tell us about how mathematics really works."--Publisher's website. 0aMathematics.1 aGardiner, A.q(Anthony),d1947-eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOBP series in mathematics ;vv. 3.x2387-1134 40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0168zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0168.jpgzConnect to cover image05626nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501280031526400470044326400110049030000590050133600260056033700260058633800360061250000440064850600480069253800360074054001650077650400510094150524220099252013050341465000630471965000510478265000540483365000310488765000340491870000280495271000380498085600580501885600920507699100575159970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         190627t20192019enka    sb    001 0 eng d  a9781783746699 (Hardback)  a9781783746682 (Paperback)  a9781783746705q(pdf)  a9781783746712q(epub)  a9781783746729q(mobi)  a9781783746736q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1107456276  aStSaULbengerda00aSocial media in higher educationh[electronic resource] :bcase studies, reflections and anlysis /cedited by Chris Rowell. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (302 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

How are universities harnessing its power to aid student learning? This innovative collection brings together academics and those working in professional services to examine these questions and more. The diverse and expert contributors analyse the many ways social media can be used to enhance teaching and learning, research, professional practice, leadership, networking and career development. The impact of social media is evaluated critically, with an eye both to the benefits and the problems of using these new forms of digital communication. This is the first volume to give such detailed attention to this area of high interest. Its innovative approach extends to its creation, with contributors found via their presence on Twitter. The short and impactful chapters are accessible while retaining an academic focus through their application of relevant learning theories and educational context. Social Media and Higher Education is essential reading for any professional working in higher education, including lecturers teaching education courses. It is also significant for researchers looking at more recent developments in the field and what it means to work in a modern higher education environment."--Publisher's website. 0aEducation, HigherxEffect of technological innovations on. 0aEducation, HigherxComputer network resources. 0aEducation, HigherxComputer-assisted instruction. 0aSocial media in education. 0aInternet in higher education.1 aRowell, Chris,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0162zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0162.jpgzConnect to cover image09738nam a2200601 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000240017002000250019402000250021902200220024402200230026603500220028904000210031124501690033225000200050126400470052126400110056830000590057933600260063833700260066433800360069049000670072650000440079350600480083753800360088554001650092150000280108650558300111452014250694465000310836965000430840065000500844365000260849365000380851965000450855765000320860265000440863465000510867870000370872970000290876670000300879570000340882570000320885971000380889183000580892985600570898785600920904499100575189970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         190627t20192019enka    s     000 0 eng d  z9781783747634 (Hardback)  z9781783747627 (Paperback)  a9781783747641 (pdf)  a9781783747658 (epub)  a9781783747665 (mobi)  z2059-4232 (Print)  a2059-4240 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1107459350  aStSaULbengerda00aWhat works in conservationh[electronic resource].n2019 /cedited by William J.

Does adding topsoil increase the abundance of heathland plants? Are interventions to reduce road impacts on amphibians effective? Do herbicides control invasive parrot's feather? What Works in Conservation has been created to provide practitioners with answers to these and many other questions about practical conservation. This book provides an assessment of the effectiveness of 1389 conservation interventions based on summarized scientific evidence. The 2019 edition contains new material on bat conservation. Other chapters cover practical global conservation of primates, peatlands, shrublands and heathlands, management of captive animals as well as an extended chapter on control of freshwater invasive species, the global conservation of amphibians, bats, birds and forests, conservation of European farmland biodiversity and some aspects of enhancing natural pest control, enhancing soil fertility and control of freshwater invasive species. It contains key results from the summarized evidence for each conservation intervention and an assessment of the effectiveness of each by international expert panels. The accompanying website www.conservationevidence.com describes each of the studies individually, and provides full references. This is the fourth edition of What Works in Conservation, which is revised on an annual basis." --Publisher's website. 0aBiodiversity conservation. 0aBiodiversity conservationxManagement. 0aBiodiversity conservationxGovernment policy. 0aHabitat conservation. 0aHabitat conservationxManagement. 0aHabitat conservationxGovernment policy. 0aEnvironmental conservation. 0aEnvironmental conservationxManagement. 0aEnvironmental conservationxGovernment policy.1 aSutherland, William J.,eeditor.1 aDicks, Lynn V.,eeditor.1 aOckenden, Nancy,eeditor.1 aPetrovan, Silviu O.,eeditor.1 aSmith, Rebecca K.,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWhat works in conservation series ;vv. 4.x2059-424040uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0179zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0179.jpgzConnect to cover image03760nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500200029804000210031810000320033924500830037126400460045426400110050030000590051133600260057033700260059633800360062250000440065850600480070253800360075054001830078650400760096950505070104552014740155260000230302665000480304965000290309771000380312685600580316485600920322299100577040970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         220830t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643758 (Hardback)  z9781800643741 (Paperback)  a9781800643765q(pdf)  a9781800646704q(HTML)  a9781800643796q(XML)  a9781800643772q(epub)  a9781800643789q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)45678476  aStSaULbengerda1 aRosengarten, Ruth,eauthor.10aSecond chanceh[electronic resource] :bmy life in things /cRuth Rosengarten. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xi, 281 pages) :b39 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

Evocative objects reflect our attitudes to our own lives and how we seek to display ourselves to ourselves. They are therefore, closely linked to our memories, and how we filter, process and reconstruct them. Rosengarten explores the themes and associations invoked by her own evocative objects, which are frequently shabby things of no material value. They are, importantly, often objects that, in their materiality, bear traces of actions, of something-having-been. Through the associative pathways that these objects have paved, she discusses her experiences with the losses she has undergone, her family's migrations, and what it means to be a childless woman. This leads her to address the question of what will become of her storied objects and the memories attached to them when she is no longer in existence. This memoir offers an interdisciplinary approach to collecting and compiling fragments of one's life, paying close attention to the evocative objects that embody us. In doing so, these essays explore loss, memory, childlessness, longing, family history, literature and art theory through material entities which reveal the immaterial 'things' at the heart of this study. This book is sure to be of interest to anyone stimulated by memory work and the relationship between humans and their possessions."--Publisher's website.10aRosengarten, Ruth. 0aPersonal belongingsxPsychological aspects. 0aAutobiographical memory.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0285zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0285.jpgzConnect to cover image03920nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024602000260027203500220029804000210032004300120034110000320035324501230038526400460050826400110055430000600056533600260062533700260065133800360067750000440071350600480075753800360080554001830084150001330102450400530115750504770121052013060168761000310299361000410302465100340306565100700309970000300316970000270319971000380322685600580326485600920332299100577135970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         220830t20222022enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643451 (Hardback)  z9781800643444 (Paperback)  a9781800643468q(pdf)  a9781800646780q(HTML)  a9781800643499q(XML)  a9781800643475q(epub)  a9781800643482q(azw3)  a(OCoLC)1348445335  aStSaULbengerda  ae-gr---1 aSt Clair, William,eauthor.14aThe classical Parthenonh[electronic resource] :brecovering the strangeness of the ancient world /cWilliam St Clair. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xiv, 330 pages) :b39 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

And, if so, how? In this book William St Clair presents a reconstructed understanding of the Parthenon from within the classical Athenian worldview. He explores its role and meaning by weaving together a range of textual and visual sources into two innovative oratorical experiments - a speech in the style of Thucydides and a first-century CE rhetorical exercise - which are used to develop a narrative analysis of the temple structure, revealing a strange story of indigeneity, origins, and empire. The Classical Parthenon offers new answers to old questions, such as the riddle of the Parthenon frieze, and provides a framing device for the wider relationship between visual artefacts, built heritage, and layers of accumulated cultural rhetoric. This groundbreaking and pertinent work will appeal across the disciplines to readers interested in the classics, art history, and the nature of history, while also speaking to a general audience that is interrogating the role of monuments in contemporary society."--Publisher's website.20aParthenon (Athens, Greece)20aParthenon (Athens, Greece)xHistory. 0aAthens (Greece)xAntiquities. 0aGreecexHistoryyWar of Independence, 1821-1829xArt and the war.1 aSt Clair, David,eeditor.1 aBarnes, Lucy,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0279zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0279.jpgzConnect to cover image03085nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026810000360028924500910032526400470041626400110046330000340047433600260050833700260053433800360056050000440059650600480064053800360068854001990072450400530092350503440097652009680132065000490228865000180233765000620235565000200241765000150243771000380245285600570249085600920254799100001160970896620250324104919.0m        d        cr##n#########150915t20152015enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783741687 (Hardback)  z9781783741670 (Paperback)  a9781783741694q(pdf)  a9781783741700q(epub)  a9781783741717q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)926061253  aStSaULbengerda1 aVelleman, James David,eauthor.10aBeyond priceh[electronic resource] :bessays on birth and death /cJ.

David Velleman challenges the prevailing consensus about assisted suicide and reproductive technology, articulating an original approach to the ethics of creating and ending human lives. He argues that assistance in dying is appropriate only at the point where talk of suicide is not, and he raises moral objections to anonymous donor conception. In their place, Velleman champions a morality of valuing personhood over happiness in making end-of-life decisions, and respecting the personhood of future children in making decisions about procreation. These controversial views are defended with philosophical rigor while remaining accessible to the general reader. Written over Velleman's 30 years of undergraduate teaching in bioethics, the essays have never before been collected and made available to a non-academic audience. They will open new lines of debate on issues of intense public interest."--Publisher's website. 0aAssisted suicidexMoral and ethical aspects. 0aRight to die. 0aHuman reproductive technologyxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aMedical ethics. 0aBioethics.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0061zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0061.jpgzConnect to cover image06134nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300210028124502120030226400470051426400110056130000740057233600260064633700260067233800360069850000440073450600480077853800360082654001660086250000660102850400510109450524090114552015870355465000340514165000470517565000390522265000290526165000290529065000190531970000350533870000360537370000320540971000380544185600570547985600920553699100003432970896620250313114126.0m     o  d        cr  n         240701t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112198 (hbk.)  z9781805112181 (pbk.)  a9781805112204q(pdf)  a9781805112235q(HTML)  a9781805112211q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1442806047  aStSaULbengerda  ae------aed-----00aPsychological perspectives on musical experiences and skillsh[electronic resource] :bresearch in the Western Balkans and Western Europe /cedited by Blanka Bogunović, Renee Timmers, and Sanela Nikolić. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xxviii, 400 pages) :b13 illustrations, 16 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

However, much of its findings and insights have remained relatively unknown outside the region. Psychological Perspectives on Musical Experiences and Skills features recent research from the Western Balkans, foregrounding its specific topics, methods, and influences, and bringing it into productive conversation with complementary research from Western Europe and further afield. The essays in this collection investigate the psychology of listening and performance and their relevance to music practice. Employing a range of research methodologies, they address divergent themes, from a cross-cultural understanding of aesthetic experiences and innovations to attract new audiences, to developmental perspectives on musical growth and the challenges of mastering performance skills. Authors reflect independently and collaboratively on how these psychological processes are shaped by the different traditions and geopolitical conditions inside and outside the Western Balkans. The result is a volume that emphasizes how musical experiences and practices happen not in isolation but in socio-cultural environments that contribute to their definition. This work will appeal to musicians, music educators, students, researchers, and psychologists with an interest in the psychology of music and exemplify ways forward in decolonizing academia.. As an accessible introduction, it should interest readers whether or not they are currently familiar with human evolutionary demography."--Publisher's website. 0aMusicxPsychological aspects. 0aMusicxPerformancexPsychological aspects. 0aMusic audienceszBalkan Peninsula. 0aMusic audienceszEurope. 0aMusiczBalkan Peninsula. 0aMusiczEurope.1 aBogunović, Blanka,eeditor. 1 aTimmers, Renee,d1974-eeditor.1 aNikolić, Sanela,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0389zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0389.jpgzConnect to cover image04626nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024502270028126400470050826400110055530001000056633600260066633700260069233800360071850000440075450600480079853800360084654001460088250400510102850511090107952015510218865000180373965000240375765000360378165000240381770000350384170000280387670000340390470000310393871000380396985600570400785600920406499100003661970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         240702t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113171 (hbk.)  z9781805113164 (pbk.)  a9781805113188q(pdf)  a9781805113201q(HTML)  a9781805113195q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1442805097  aStSaULbengerda00aAntisemitism in online communicationh[electronic resource] :btransdisciplinary approaches to hate speech for the twenty-first century /cedited by Matthias J.

While global efforts have been made to counter contemporary antisemitism, there is an urgent need to understand its online manifestations. Hate speech spreads easily across the internet, facilitated by anonymity and reinforced by algorithms that favour engaging--even if offensive--content. It often takes coded forms, making detection challenging. Antisemitism in Online Communication addresses these issues by analysing explicit and implicit antisemitic statements in mainstream online discourse. Drawing from disciplines such as corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, semiotics, history, and philosophy, this edited collection examines over 100,000 user comments from three language communities. Contributors explore various facets of online antisemitism, including its intersectionality with misogyny and its dissemination through memes and social networks. Through case studies, they examine the reproduction, support, and rejection of antisemitic tropes, alongside quantitative assessments of comment structures in online discussions. Additionally, the volume delves into the capabilities of content moderation tools and deep-learning models for automated hate speech detection. This multidisciplinary approach provides a comprehensive understanding of contemporary antisemitism in digital spaces, recognising the importance of addressing its insidious spread from multiple angles."--Publisher's website. 0aAntisemitism. 0aOnline hate speech. 0aOnline hate speechxPrevention. 0aDiscourse analysis.1 aBecker, Matthias J.,eeditor. 1 aAscone, Laura,eeditor.1 aPlaczynta, Karolina,eeditor.1 aVincent, Chloé,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0406zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0406.jpgzConnect to cover image03878nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000300028124500890031126400470040026400110044730000400045833600260049833700260052433800360055050000440058650600480063053800360067854001660071450400530088050503490093352016570128260000470293961000730298665000520305965000520311165100350316365100350319871000380323385600570327185600920332899100003676970896620250313114119.0m     o  d        cr  n         240702t20242024enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111955 (hbk.)  z9781805111948 (pbk.)  a9781805111948q(pdf)  a9781805111993q(HTML)  a9781805111979q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1443867933  aStSaULbengerda1 aHughes, Michael,eauthor.10aFeliks Volkhovskiih[electronic resource] :ba revolutionary life /cMichael Hughes. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xiv, 340 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

He lived through pivotal changes ranging from the rise of 'nihilism' in the 1860s and the growth of populism in the 1870s, through to the creation of the Socialist Revolutionary Party in the early 1900s. Imprisoned three times before he turned thirty, he spent ten years in Siberian exile before fleeing abroad to join the fight against tsarist autocracy from western Europe. Following Volkhovskii's arrival in Britain in 1890, he played a central role in the campaign to win sympathy for the Russian revolutionary movement, editing newspapers and journals including Free Russia. He also helped to smuggle propaganda into Russia as well as becoming one of the most prominent figures in the émigré leadership of the Socialist Revolutionaries. Throughout his life, Volkhovskii was also a prolific writer of poetry and short stories, and was on good terms with many leading literary figures of the time including Ford Maddox Ford and Edward and Constance Garnett. Michael Hughes's groundbreaking new biography provides a vivid history of this notable but hitherto neglected figure of both the political and literary worlds. Based on ten years of research in archives across the world and drawing on sources in multiple languages, this masterful biography explores how Volkhovskii's life illuminates broader intellectual and historical questions about the Russian revolutionary movement. It is essential reading for anyone interested in late Imperial Russia and the Russian revolution."--Publisher's website.10aVolkhovskīĭ, F.q(Feliks),d1846-1914.20aPartīi︠a︡ sot︠s︡īalistov-revoli︠u︡t︠s︡īonerov. 0aRevolutionarieszRussiaxHistoryy19th century. 0aRevolutionarieszRussiaxHistoryy20th century. 0aRussiaxHistoryy19th century. 0aRussiaxHistoryy20th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0385zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0385.jpgzConnect to cover image04260nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028110000350029324501490032826400470047726400110052430000660053533600260060133700260062733800360065350000440068950600480073353800360078154001660081750000650098350400670104850505030111552017690161865000510338765000560343865000890349470000320358371000380361585600570365385600920371099100004547970896620250313114128.0m     o  d        cr  n         240705t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112679 (hbk.)  z9781805112662 (pbk.)  a9781805112686q(pdf)  a9781805112716q(HTML)  a9781805112693q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1442804273  aStSaULbengerda  ae-gw---1 aLähnemann, Henrike,eauthor.14aThe life of nunsh[electronic resource] :blove, politics, and religion in medieval German convents /cHenrike Lähnemann and Eva Schlotheuber. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (vi, 204 pages) :b44 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

What, though, were their motives for entering a convent and what was their daily routine behind its walls like? How did they think, live and worship, both as individuals and as a community? How did they maintain contact with the families and communities they had left behind? Henrike Lähnemann and Eva Schlotheuber offer readers a vivid insight into the largely unknown lives and work of religious women in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Using previously inaccessible personal diaries and letters, as well as tapestries, painting, architecture and music, the authors show that the nuns were, in fact, an active, even influential part of medieval society. They functioned as role models and engaged in spirited dialogue with other convents, with the citizens of their home towns and with the local nobility. Full of self-confidence, they organised their demanding daily lives; ran their complex convent economies as successful businesses; offered girls a comprehensive theological, musical and practical education; produced magnificent manuscripts; ministered to the convent sick and dying with homemade medicines and to family and friends with advice. Initially-and fiercely-they resisted the Reformation, only for some of the convents to survive as Protestant women's foundations to this day. Now, for the first time in centuries, this account by Henrike Lähnemann and Eva Schlotheuber allows the voices of these remarkable women to be heard outside the cloister and to invite us into their world."--Publisher's website. 0aNunszGermanyxHistoryyMiddle Ages, 600-1500. 0aNunszGermanyxSocial conditionsxHistoryyTo 1500. 0aMonasticism and religious orders for womenzGermanyxHistoryyMiddle Ages, 600-1500.1 aSchlotheuber, Eva,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0397zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0397.jpgzConnect to cover image05205nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024501650028126400470044626400110049330000700050433600260057433700260060033800360062650000440066250600480070653800360075454001660079050400530095650518430100952015430285265000450439565000280444065000230446865000210449170000310451270000290454371000380457285600570461085600920466799100004550970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         240705t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113034 (hbk.)  z9781805113027 (pbk.)  a9781805113041q(pdf)  a9781805113072q(HTML)  a9781805113058q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1443868876  aStSaULbengerda00aMusic and spiritualityh[electronic resource] :btheological approaches, empirical methods, and Christian worship /cedited by George Corbett and Sarah Moerman. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xiv, 464 pages) :b18 illustrations, 2 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

In listening to music, we are drawn to dimensions of human experience beyond the material. This collection brings together leading scholars from various disciplines - including Christian theology, musicology, and psychology and neuroscience - to interrogate the intimate relationship between music and spirituality. Organised in three parts - theological approaches, empirical methods, and Christian worship - the volume covers a vibrant array of topics. From examining how the Covid-19 pandemic has reshaped the profile of contemporary worship to investigating the spiritual effects of bodily positioning in liturgical spaces, from exploring spiritual experience through heart and breathing activity, electrodermal activity, and saliva samples to comparing the spiritual experiences of British Methodists with Welsh sporting fans, these essays attend to the lived reality of people's perceived spiritual experiences through music. This collection will be an invaluable resource for scholars in the growing field of Christian theology and music, and will serve as a cornerstone for future research at the intersection of theology, music, and psychology and neuroscience. It will also appeal to anyone curious about why music consistently, across cultures, occupies a unique space bridging the material and spiritual dimensions of human life."--Publisher's website. 0aMusicxReligious aspectsxChristianity.  0aSpirituality in music.  0aMusic in churches. 0aEthnomusicology.1 aCorbett, George,eeditor. 1 aMoerman, Sarah,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0403zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0403.jpgzConnect to cover image10503nam a2200553 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031424501820033526400470051726400110056430000650057533600260064033700260066633800360069249000490072850000440077750600480082153800360086954001650090550000530107050400410112350566120116452016180777665000190939465000400941365000360945365000330948965000450952265000230956765000220959070000280961270000360964070000360967671000380971283000500975085600570980085600920985799100013554970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         151116t20152015enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783741946 (Hardback)  z9781783741939 (Paperback)  a9781783741953q(pdf)  a9781783741960q(epub)  a9781783741977q(mobi)  z2059-4232 (Print)  a2059-4240 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1151509138  aStSaULbengerda00aForests and foodh[electronic resource] :baddressing hunger and nutrition across sustainable landscapes /cedited by Bhaskar Vira, Christoph Wildburger and Stephane Mansourian. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (viii, 280 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aWhat works in conservation seriesx2059-4240  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

A total of 805 million people are undernourished worldwide and malnutrition affects nearly every country on the planet. Despite impressive productivity increases, there is growing evidence that conventional agricultural strategies fall short of eliminating global hunger, as well as having long-term ecological consequences. Forests can play an important role in complementing agricultural production to address the Sustainable Development Goals on zero hunger. Forests and trees can be managed to provide better and more nutritionally-balanced diets, greater control over food inputs-particularly during lean seasons and periods of vulnerability (especially for marginalised groups)-and deliver ecosystem services for crop production. However forests are undergoing a rapid process of degradation, a complex process that governments are struggling to reverse. This volume provides important evidence and insights about the potential of forests to reducing global hunger and malnutrition, exploring the different roles of landscapes, and the governance approaches that are required for the equitable delivery of these benefits. Forests and Food is essential reading for researchers, students, NGOs and government departments responsible for agriculture, forestry, food security and poverty alleviation around the globe.

Since their establishment as scientific tools for classification in the eighteenth century, diagrams have been used to determine but also to deny kinship between human groups. In nineteenth-century craniometry, they were omnipresent in attempts to standardize measurements on skulls for hierarchical categorization. In particular the 'human family tree' was central for evolutionary understandings of human diversity, being used on both sides of debates about whether humans constitute different species well into the twentieth century. With recent advances in (ancient) DNA analyses, the tree diagram has become more contested than ever-does human relatedness take the shape of a network? Are human individual genomes mosaics made up of different ancestries? Sommer examines the epistemic and political role of these visual representations in the history of 'race' as an anthropological category. How do such diagrams relate to imperial and (post-)colonial practices and ideologies but also to liberal and humanist concerns? The Diagrammatics of 'Race' concentrates on Western projects from the late 1700s into the present to diagrammatically define humanity, subdividing and ordering it, including the concomitant endeavors to acquire representative samples-bones, blood, or DNA-from all over the world. Contributing to the 'diagrammatic turn' in the humanities and social sciences, it reveals connections between diagrams in anthropology and other visual traditions, including in religion, linguistics, biology, genealogy, breeding, and eugenics."--Publisher's website. 0aRacexResearch. 0aHuman evolutionxResearch. 0aAnthropologyxResearch. 0aCharts, diagrams, etc.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0396zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0396.jpgzConnect to cover image06270nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000260016102000260018703500220021304000210023504300130025624501940026926400470046326400110051030000730052133600260059433700260062033800360064650000440068250600480072653800360077454001660081050000400097650400390101650525730105552018000362865000360542865000390546465000340550370000290553770000290556670000300559571000380562585600570566385600920572099100014037970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         240808t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112969 (pbk.)  a9781805112983q(pdf)  a9781805113010q(HTML)  a9781805112990q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1450859900  aStSaULbengerda  af-sx--- 00aEtosha Pan to the Skeleton Coasth[electronic resource] :bconservation histories, policies and practices in North-west Namibia /cedited by Sian Sullivan, Ute Dieckmann and Selma Lendelvo. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xxiv, 566 pages) :b156 illustrations, 16 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

This cross-disciplinary volume brings together contributions from a Namibian and international group of scholars and conservation practitioners, working on topics ranging from colonial histories to water management, perceptions of 'wildlife' and the politics of belonging. Together, these essays confront a critical question: how can the conservation of biodiversity-rich landscapes be reconciled with historical injustices of social exclusion and marginalisation? The book is organised in five parts: the first provides a historical backdrop for the book's detailed case studies, focusing on environmental and conservation policy and legislation; the second investigates post-Independence approaches to conservation; the third focuses on 'Etosha-Kunene' ecologies and related management issues; the fourth explores how historical circumstances shape present conservation and cultural landscapes; and the fifth addresses contemporary complexities of lion conservation and community-based natural resource management (CBNRM). By offering a comprehensive overview of evolving conservation boundaries, policies and practices in the region, this timely volume paves the way for the future design of conservation initiatives that more fully consider and integrate historical and cultural knowledge and diversity. Essential reading for conservation practitioners, policymakers, and academic researchers alike, this volume also serves as a valuable resource for university students interested in conservation studies and histories of conservation."--Publisher's website. 0aWildlife conservationzNamibia. 0aEnvironmental protectionzNamibia. 0aNature conservationzNamibia.1 aSullivan, Sian,eeditor.1 aDieckmann, Ute,eeditor.1 aLendelvo, Selma,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0402zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0402.jpgzConnect to cover image03260nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000300028124501040031126400470041526400110046230000600047333600260053333700260055933800360058550000440062150600480066553800360071354001900074950400550093950504830099452010840147765000190256165000190258065000160259965000240261571000380263985600570267785600920273499100014240970896620250313114127.0m     o  d        cr  n         240809t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648784 (hbk.)  z9781800648777 (pbk.)  a9781800648791q(pdf)  a9781800648838q(HTML)  a9781800648807q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1452474704  aStSaULbengerda1 aTumino, Stephen,eauthor.10aThinking blue, writing redh[electronic resource] :bMarxism and the (post)human /cStephen Tumino. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (viii, 300 pages) :b6 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Inspired by Derrida's idea of the secret, Tumino examines the significance of social movements (Black Lives Matter, Occupy, alter-globalization) and naïve art (Darger, Ryden) to argue that these texts speak of the secrets that capitalism cannot speak. Contending that the cultural surfaces narrate only the 'nonsecret,' that to see the social logic of the culture one must dig into what Bruno Latour questions as the 'deep dark below,' Thinking Blue/Writing Red reads these texts to tease out the underlying narratives of the culture of capital. This book will be of interest to students in several disciplines, including philosophy, literary and cultural studies, film studies, women's studies, critical race studies, history, LGBTQ+ studies and environmental studies."--Publisher's website. 0aNeoliberalism. 0aGlobalization. 0aCapitalism. 0aDiscourse analysis.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0324zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0324.jpgzConnect to cover image02822nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026810000360028924500820032525000290040726400470043626400110048330000390049433600260053333700260055933800360058550000440062150600480066553800360071354001990074950000380094850400530098650503010103952008490134065000240218971000380221385600570225185600920230899100019809970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         151201t20152015enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783740338 (Hardback)  z9781783740321 (Paperback)  a9781783740345q(pdf)  a9781783740352q(epub)  a9781783740369q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)960810340  aStSaULbengerda1 aVelleman, James David,eauthor.10aFoundations for moral relativismh[electronic resource] /cJ.

J. David Velleman shows that different communities can indeed be subject to incompatible moralities, because their local mores are rationally binding. At the same time, he explains why the mores of different communities, even when incompatible, are still variations on the same moral themes. The book thus maps out a universe of many moral worlds without, as Velleman puts it, "moral black holes". The six self-standing chapters discuss such diverse topics as online avatars and virtual worlds, lying in Russian and truth-telling in Quechua, the pleasure of solitude and the fear of absurdity. Accessibly written, this book presupposes no prior training in philosophy.

The neighbourhoods are only a few kilometres apart, yet whilst one is relatively affluent, the other is amongst the most economically deprived in the UK. Tyneside Neighbourhoods uses multiple research methods to explore social relationships and social behaviour, attempting to understand whether the experience of deprivation fosters social solidarity, or undermines it. The book is distinctive in its development of novel quantitative methods for ethnography: systematic social observation, economic games, household surveys, crime statistics, and field experiments. Nettle analyses these findings in the context of the cultural, psychological and economic consequences of economic deprivation, and of the ethical difficulties of representing a deprived community. In so doing the book sheds light on one of the main issues of our time: the roles of culture and of socioeconomic factors in determining patterns of human social behaviour. Tyneside Neighbourhoods is a must read for scholars, students, individual readers, charities and government departments seeking insight into the social consequences of deprivation and inequality in the West."--Publisher's website. 0aEqualityzEnglandvCase studies. 0aHuman behaviorxEconomic aspects. 0aEqualityxEconomic aspects. 0aEconomicsxSociological aspects. 0aAnthropologyxFieldworkxMethodology. 0aEthnologyxFieldworkxMethodology. 0aNewcastle-upon-Tyne (England)xEconomic conditionsvCase studies. 0aNewcastle-upon-Tyne (England)xSocial conditionsvCase studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0084zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0084.jpgzConnect to cover image08950nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031313000500033424501240038426400470050826400110055530000710056633600260063733700260066333800360068949000520072550000440077750600480082153800360086954001980090550000830110350002120118650400410139850555490143952009700698854600320795865000160799065000380800665000480804465100540809270000440814671000380819083000430822885600570827185600920832899100027503970896620250313114127.0m        d        cr  n         151218t20162016enka    sb    000 0deng d  z9781783742042 (Hardback)  z9781783742035 (Paperback)  a9781783742059q(pdf)  a9781783742066q(epub)  a9781783742073q(mobi)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)934476780  aStSaULbengerda0 aTolerance: le combat des Lumières.lEnglish00aToleranceh[electronic resource] :bthe beacon of the Enlightenment /cedited and translated by Caroline Warman, et al. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (viii, 136 pages) :billustrations (some colour)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen Book classics series.x2054-2178 ;vvol. 3  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

These passages are immensely diverse in style and topic, but all have in common a passionate commitment to equality, freedom, and tolerance. Each text resonates powerfully with the issues our world faces today. Tolerance was first published by the Société française d'étude du dix-huitième siècle (the French Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies) in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo assassinations in January 2015 as an act of solidarity and as a response to the surge of interest in Enlightenment values. With the support of the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies, it has now been translated by over 100 students and tutors of French at Oxford University."--Publisher's website.  aTranslated from the French. 0aToleration. 0aEnlightenmentzFrancexInfluence. 0aPhilosophy, Frenchy18th centuryvSources.  0aFrancexIntellectual lifey18th centuryvSources.1 aWarman, Caroline,eeditor,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen Book classics ;vv. 3.x2054-217840uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0088zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0088.jpgzConnect to cover image03580nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025504100130027610000330028924501920032226400470051426400110056130000410057233600260061333700260063933800360066549000670070150000440076850600480081253800360086054001660089650000700106250000920113250400530122454600870127750501290136452010680149365000310256165000280259265000300262065000450265070000350269571000750273071000380280583000560284385600570289985600940295699100029203970896620250313114119.0m     o  d        cr  n         240822t20242024enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113850 (hbk.)  z9781805113843 (pbk.)  a9781805113867q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1452474735  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghsem1 aCastagna, Giuliano,eauthor.13aAn annotated corpus of three hundred proverbs, sayings, and idioms in Eastern Jibbali/Śḥərɛ̄́th[electronic resource] /cGiuliano Castagna ; with a contribution by Suhail al-Amri. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (viii, 248 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 26  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Reflecting the historical value of proverbs and idiomatic expression within the documentation of a language, Giuliano Castagna analyses a sizeable share of Jibbali/Śḥərɛ̄́t proverbs, sayings and idioms from Arabic-language publications, as well as hitherto unpublished expressions that reveal undocumented features in the domains of lexicon, phonetics, phonology and morphology. Castagna's grammatical analysis (phonetic, phonological and morphological) of these pieces of folk knowledge underpins the documentation of an obsolete lexicon. It is accompanied by a brief introduction to the study of proverbs (paremiology) and a succinct grammatical sketch of Jibbali/Śḥərɛ̄́t, making the book useful both to experts and to students of these topics."--Publisher's website.  0aJibbali languagexHistory. 0aJibbali languagezOman. 0aJibbali languagexIdioms. 0aProverbs, ArabicxHistory and criticism.1 aAl-Amri, Suhail,econtributor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 26.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0422zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0422.jpgzConnect to cover image  06403nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026910000390029024501290032926400470045826400110050530000400051633600260055633700260058233800360060850000440064450600480068853800360073654001650077250000520093750400690098950531770105852015310423565000160576665000120578271000380579485600570583285600920588999100034338970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         160115t20162016enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783741991 (Hardback)  z9781783741984 (Paperback)  a9781783742004q(pdf)  a9781783742011q(epub)  a9781783742028q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)937024920   aStSaULbengerda1 aWilson, Catherine,d1951-eauthor.10aMetaethics from a first person standpointh[electronic resource] :ban introduction to moral philosophy /cCatherine Wilson. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (viii, 124 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

The Enquirer finds that the moral opinions and practices of mankind form a confusing jumble in which, while strong convictions reign, it is hard to see why any moral claims can claim to be true or to be known by anyone. She decides to doubt everything she has assumed hitherto about moral good and moral evil and her understanding of them. -- Enquiry II. The Enquirer decides to doubt whether any actions, situations, events, and persons can really be good or bad, right or wrong, morally permissible or morally impermissible. -- Enquiry III. The Enquirer continues to ponder the notion of a value-free universe. She comes to the realisation that the world seems to be saturated experientially and linguistically with values. She entertains the possibility that a race of Destroyers of Illusion who use language differently has discovered that values are unreal and that there are only likings and dislikings. She discovers nevertheless that she does know at least one fact about what is good. -- Enquiry IV. The Enquirer discovers that, as far as her self-interest is concerned, there are certain things that are good and bad for her and therefore things she ought and ought not to do. The Enquirer discovers that she can also know something about what is in the self-interest of other people. --  Enquiry V. The Enquirer discovers that she knows some of the 'Norms of Civility' dictating how Person 1 ought to behave towards Person 2 in certain typical situations and wonders why these norms are observed and whether it is always good to observe them. -- Enquiry VI. The Enquirer determines what makes a relationship between Person 1 and Person 2 morally significant and investigates the origins of hermoral feelings and attitudes. She then discovers that prudence and self-interest sometimes have a moral dimension insofar as they concern the relations between a Present Self and a Future Self. -- Enquiry VII. The Enquirer discovers an analogy between the Present Self's natural and moral concern for the Future Self and the Narrow Self's natural and moral concern for the Extended Self of kith and kin. She goes on to ponder whether she has any natural concern for Strangers and why she ought to care about them. -- Enquiry VIII. The Enquirer returns to a consideration of the position of the Destroyers of Illusion to try to determine whether moral claims are nothing more than claims about the likings and dislikings of the person who asserts them, or nothing more than expressions of attitudes and the issuing of invitations and commands, without any epistemic significance. She comes to the conclusion that the Destroyers lack a coherent position, and she goes on to consider how to think about moral norms and demands and the possible motives and reasons for being moral. -- Enquiry IX. The Enquirer ponders the questions of whether there are moral truths, whether there is a method for discovering them, and what the reach and limits of moral knowledge might be. She considers in what sense there has been moral progress and an increase in moral knowledge. -- Summary -- Endnotes -- Suggestions for Further Study.  a"Metaethics from a First Person Standpoint addresses in a novel format the major topics and themes of contemporary metaethics, the study of the analysis of moral thought and judgement. Metathetics is less concerned with what practices are right or wrong than with what we mean by 'right' and 'wrong.' Looking at a wide spectrum of topics including moral language, realism and anti-realism, reasons and motives, relativism, and moral progress, this book engages students and general readers in order to enhance their understanding of morality and moral discourse as cultural practices. Catherine Wilson innovatively employs a first-person narrator to report step-by-step an individual's reflections, beginning from a position of radical scepticism, on the possibility of objective moral knowledge. The reader is invited to follow along with this reasoning, and to challenge or agree with each major point. Incrementally, the narrator is led to certain definite conclusions about 'oughts' and norms in connection with self-interest, prudence, social norms, and finally morality. Scepticism is overcome, and the narrator arrives at a good understanding of how moral knowledge and moral progress are possible, though frequently long in coming. Accessibly written, Metaethics from a First Person Standpoint presupposes no prior training in philosophy and is a must-read for philosophers, students and general readers interested in gaining a better understanding of morality as a personal philosophical quest."--Publisher's website. 0aMetaethics. 0aEthics.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0087zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0087.jpgzConnect to cover image03706nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000380028124501370031926400470045626400110050330000520051433600260056633700260059233800360061850000440065450600480069853800360074654002000078250400550098250504510103752013440148865000440283265000480287665000290292465000330295365000330298665000420301971000380306185600570309985600920315699100035006970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         240905t20242024enkd    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113621 (hbk.)  z9781805113614 (pbk.)  a9781805113638q(pdf)  a9781805113652q(HTML)  a9781805113645q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1453602802  aStSaULbengerda1 aMorales-Harley, Roberto,eauthor.14aThe embassy, the ambush, and the ogreh[electronic resource] :bGreco-Roman influence in Sanskrit theater /cRoberto Morales-Harley. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xii, 276 pages) :b4 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Sanskrit Authors Adapting Greco-Roman Texts: Influences in the Adaptation Techniques / Roberto Morales-Harley.  a"This volume presents a sophisticated and intricate examination of the parallels between Sanskrit and Greco-Roman literature. By means of a philological and literary analysis, Morales-Harley hypothesizes that Greco-Roman literature was known, understood, and recreated in India. Moreover, it is argued that the techniques for adapting epic into theater could have been Greco-Roman influences in India, and that some of the elements adapted within the literary motifs (specifically the motifs of the embassy, the ambush, and the ogre) could have been Greco-Roman borrowings by Sanskrit authors. This book draws on a wide variety of sources, including Iliad, Phoenix, Rhesus and Cyclops (Greco-Roman) as well as Mahābhārata, The Embassy, The Five Nights and The Middle One (Sanskrit). The result is a well-supported argument which presents us with the possibility of cultural exchange between the Greco-Roman world and India - a possibility which, though hypothetical, is worth acknowledging. Due to its comparative nature, this volume will appeal to both Indologists and Classicists, including Mahābhārata scholars, Sanskrit theater scholars, and those interested in comparative work with Sanskrit literature. It brings an original perspective to the field, and provides inspiration for new lines of research."--Publisher's website. 0aSanskrit dramaxHistory and literature. 0aSanskrit literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aTheaterzIndiaxHistory. 0aGreek literaturexInfluence. 0aRoman literaturexInfluence. 0aCivilization, Greco-RomanxInfluence.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0417zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0417.jpgzConnect to cover image07807nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024500960028126400470037726400110042430000720043533600260050733700260053333800360055950000440059550600480063953800360068754001660072350000650088950001200095450400510107450536980112552021190482365000320694265000290697465000330700365000210703670000270705770000260708471000380711074000280714885600570717685600920723399100035029970896620250313114123.0m     o  d        cr  n         240905t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111153 (hbk.)  z9781805111146 (pbk.)  a9781805111160q(pdf)  a9781805111207q(HTML)  a9781805111177q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1454830358  aStSaULbengerda03aAn anthology of global riskh[electronic resource] /cedited by S.

It serves to complement the previous volume The Era of Global Risk: An Introduction to Existential Risk Studies by providing open access to original research and insights in this rapidly evolving field. At its heart, this book highlights the ongoing development of new academic paradigms and theories of change that have emerged from a community of researchers in and around the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. The chapters in this book challenge received notions of human extinction and civilization collapse and seek to chart new paths towards existential security and hope. The volume curates a series of research articles, including previously published and unpublished work, exploring the nature and ethics of catastrophic global risk, the tools and methodologies being developed to study it, the diverse drivers that are currently pushing it to unprecedented levels of danger, and the pathways and opportunities for reducing this. In each case, they go beyond simplistic and reductionist accounts of risk to understand how a diverse range of factors interact to shape both catastrophic threats and our vulnerability and exposure to them and reflect on different stakeholder communities, policy mechanisms, and theories of change that can help to mitigate and manage this risk. Bringing together experts from across diverse disciplines, the anthology provides an accessible survey of the current state of the art in this emerging field. The interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary nature of the cutting-edge research presented here makes this volume a key resource for researchers and academics. However, the editors have also prepared introductions and research highlights that will make it accessible to an interested general audience as well. Whatever their level of experience, the volume aims to challenge readers to take on board the extent of the multiple dangers currently faced by humanity, and to think critically and proactively about reducing global risk."--Publisher's website. 0aDisastersxRisk assessment. 0aEnvironmental disasters. 0aTechnologyxRisk assessment. 0aRisk assessment.1 aBeard, S.

But he was far more than just a mathematician. Because much of his voluminous written output on various subjects was scattered throughout journals and encyclopaedias, the breadth of his interests and contributions has been underappreciated by historians. Now, renewed interest in De Morgan's life and work has coincided with the digitization of his extensive library, revealing the extent to which he pioneered and influenced the development of not merely mathematics but also logic, astronomy, the history of mathematics, education, and bibliography. This edited collection celebrates De Morgan as a polymath. Drawing together multiple elements of his activity from a range of publications and archives, its contributors re-assess his academic work, his place in his intellectual environment, and his legacy. The result offers new insight into De Morgan himself as well as the wider circles in which he moved, including his family life."--Publisher's website.10aDe Morgan, Augustus,d1806-1871. 0aMathematicianszGreat BritainxHistoryy19th centuryvBiography. 0aMathematicsxStudy and teachingzGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century.1 aAttar, Karen,eeditor,eauthor. 1 aRice, Adrian C.q(Adrian Clifford),d1970-eeditor,euthor.1 aStray, Christopher,eeditor,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0408zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0408.jpgzConnect to cover image04075nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000300028124500720031126400470038326400110043030000580044133600260049933700260052533800360055150000440058750600480063153800360067954001660071550400530088150504910093452018340142560000420325965000530330165000530335465000470340771000380345485600570349285600920354999100035711970896620250313114127.0m     o  d        cr  n         240910t20242024enka    sb    001 0beng d  z9781805111535 (hbk.)  z9781805111528 (pbk.)  a9781805111542q(pdf)  a9781805111573q(HTML)  a9781805111559q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1454830435  aStSaULbengerda1 aFisher, Barbara,eauthor.10aTrixh[electronic resource] :bthe other Kipling /cBarbara Fisher. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (x, 250 pages) :b29 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Rarely portrayed with sympathy or accuracy in biographies of her famous brother Rudyard, Trix was a talented writer and a memorable character in her own right whose fascinating life was unknown until now. In telling Trix's story, Barbara Fisher rescues her from the misrepresentations, trivializations, and outright neglect of Rudyard's many biographers. This book provides the first account of Trix's life, beginning with the horrible childhood she shared with Rudyard as a Raj orphan in England. The biography follows adolescent Trix as she returned to India, where her brother encouraged her to write poems and stories, which were regularly mistaken for his. Her marriage to a stiff Scottish officer is chronicled from its hopeful beginnings through its childless, cheerless middle to its calm and compromised end. Trix's bouts of mental illness are described in sympathetic detail. Turning her attention to Trix's oeuvre Barbara Fisher locates and attributes all of her short fiction, poetry, and journalism, giving special attention to Trix's two ambitious but flawed novels. She also puts into historical context Trix's long and productive participation as a medium for the Society for Psychical Research. Most importantly, Trix: The Other Kipling gives a voice, a mind, and a heart to a misunderstood, misrepresented, but indomitable woman - an accomplishment which will be of great interest to readers interested in Victorian women authors, in the cultural interchanges between England and colonial India, in serious psychical research, in the early treatment of mental illness, and more generally, in the everyday life and struggles of intellectual women of the 19th and early 20th century."--Publisher's website.10aFleming, Alice Macdonald,d1868-1948. 0aWomen authors, Englishy19th centuryvBiography. 0aWomen authors, Englishy20th centuryvBiography. 0aWomen authors, EnglishxSocial conditions.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0377zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0377.jpgzConnect to cover image05438nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028124502170029326400470051026400110055730000700056833600260063833700260066433800360069050000440072650600480077053800360081854001660085450000650102050400510108550515240113652018050266065000590446565000240452465100520454870000280460070000270462870000370465570000310469270000340472371000380475785600570479585600920485299100035751970896620250606154411.0m     o  d        cr##n#########240910t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112914 (hbk.)  z9781805112907 (pbk.)  a9781805112921q(pdf)  a9781805112952q(HTML)  a9781805112938q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1455619605  aStSaULbengerda  ae-be---00aBitter-sweet democracy?h[electronic resource] :banalyzing citizens' resentment towards politics in Belgium /cedited by Louise Knops, Karen Celis, Virginie Van Ingelgom, Heidi Mercenier, and François Randour. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xx, 316 pages) :b16 illustrations, 20 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

But what does this phrase actually entail, and what is its relevance today? How do citizens themselves experience, feel and respond to this 'crisis'? Bitter-Sweet Democracy grapples with the complexities of these questions in the context of citizens' relations to politics in Belgium-a nation that has experienced political instability and protests as well as social mobilization and democratic vitality in recent years. This timely and compelling volume offers new, empirical evidence on the state of trust, democracy and representation in Belgium; it further introduces an innovative methodological and conceptual framework to study this 'crisis', specifically by developing the concept of political resentment. The essays in this collection span diverse topics, from citizens' conceptions of democracy itself and the expression of political resentment among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, to the influence of different emotional dimensions of resentment on protest behaviours. By adopting a distinctive affective lens and by building upon the specific case of Belgium, this volume contributes to the broader conversation on political resentment and the critical role of emotions in contemporary politics. Bitter-Sweet Democracy will be invaluable for scholars researching the relationship between emotions and politics, political representation and democracy, and citizen-led conceptualizations of politics. It will also appeal to decision-makers and citizens seeking to understand the challenges facing democracy, as well as a wider audience of academics and students in the fields of political science, political psychology and sociology."--Publisher's website. 0aRepresentative government and representationzBelgium. 0aDemocracyzBelgium. 0aBelgiumxPolitics and governmenty21st century.1 aKnops, Louise,eeditor.1 aCelis, Karen,eeditor.1 aVan Ingelgom, Virginie,eeditor.1 aMercenier, Heidi,eeditor.1 aRandour, François,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0401zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0401.jpgzConnect to cover image07184nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026910000280029024501140031824600900043226400470052226400110056930000640058033600260064433700260067033800360069650000440073250600480077653800360082454001650086050400530102550533610107852019200443960000460635965000260640565000600643165000600649171000380655185600570658985600920664699100039064970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         160126t20162016enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781909254961 (Hardback)  z9781909254954 (Paperback)  a9781909254978q(pdf)  a9781909254985q(epub)  a9781909254992q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1171041125  aStSaULbengerda1 aPaulin, Roger,eauthor.14aThe life of August Wilhelm Schlegelh[electronic resource] :bcosmopolitan of art and poetry /cRoger Paulin.13iPublisher's website title :aAugust Wilhelm Schlegel : cosmopolitan of art and poetry 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (xiv, 664 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

As poet, translator, critic and oriental scholar, Schlegel's extraordinarily diverse interests and writings left a vast intellectual legacy, making him a foundational figure in several branches of knowledge. He was one of the last thinkers in Europe able to practise as well as to theorise, and to attempt to comprehend the nature of culture without being forced to be a narrow specialist. With his brother Friedrich, for example, Schlegel edited the avant-garde Romantic periodical Athenaeum; and he produced with his wife Caroline a translation of Shakespeare, the first metrical version into any foreign language. Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature were a defining force for Coleridge and for the French Romantics. But his interests extended to French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese literature, as well to the Greek and Latin classics, and to Sanskrit.   August Wilhelm Schlegel is the first attempt to engage with this totality, to combine an account of Schlegel's life and times with a critical evaluation of his work and its influence. Through the study of one man's rich life, incorporating the most recent scholarship, theoretical approaches, and archival resources, while remaining easily accessible to all readers, Paulin has recovered the intellectual climate of Romanticism in Germany and traced its development into a still-potent international movement. The extraordinarily wide scope and variety of Schlegel's activities have hitherto acted as a barrier to literary scholars, even in Germany. In Roger Paulin, whose career has given him the knowledge and the experience to grapple with such an ambitious project, Schlegel has at last found a worthy exponent."--Publisher's website.10aSchlegel, August Wilhelm von,d1767-1845. 0aRomanticismzGermany. 0aGerman literaturey18th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aGerman literaturey19th centuryxHistory and criticism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0069zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0069.jpgzConnect to cover image04612nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028524502120030626400470051826400110056530000700057633600260064633600330067233700260070533800360073150000440076750600480081153800360085954001650089550400510106050513570111152013040246865000200377265000270379270000330381970000320385270000330388470000380391771000380395585600570399385600920405099100043605970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         200911t20202020enkag   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783747337 (hbk.)  z9781783747320 (pbk.)  a9781783747344q(pdf)  a9781783747351q(epub)  a9781783747368q(mobi)  a9781783747375q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1229563738  aStSaULbengerda00aWaltzing through Europeh[electronic resource] :battitudes towards couple dances in the long nineteenth century /cedited by Egil Bakka, Theresa Jill Buckland, Helena Saarikoski, and Anne von Bibra Wharton. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (494 pages) :b144 colour illustrations, music.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

A refreshing intervention in dance studies, this book brings together elements of historiography, cultural memory, folklore, and dance across comparatively narrow but markedly heterogeneous localities. Rooted in investigations of often newly discovered primary sources, the essays afford many opportunities to compare sociocultural and political reactions to the arrival and practice of popular rotating couple dances, such as the Waltz and the Polka. Leading contributors provide a transnational and affective lens onto strikingly diverse topics, ranging from the evolution of romantic couple dances in Croatia, and Strauss's visits to Hamburg and Altona in the 1830s, to dance as a tool of cultural preservation and expression in twentieth-century Finland. Waltzing Through Europe creates openings for fresh collaborations in dance historiography and cultural history across fields and genres. It is essential reading for researchers of dance in central and northern Europe, while also appealing to the general reader who wants to learn more about the vibrant histories of these familiar dance forms."--Publisher's website.  0aWaltzxHistory. 0aWaltzxSocial aspects.1 aBakka, Egil,d1943-eeditor.1 aBuckland, Theresa,eeditor.1 aSaarikoski, Helena,eeditor.1 aWharton, Anne von Bibra,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0174zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0174.jpgzConnect to cover image05281nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024702200220027202200230029403500220031704000210033904300120036010000300037224501050040226400470050726400110055430000340056533600260059933700260062533800360065149000550068750000440074250600480078653800360083454001650087050000950103550400430113050517190117352014830289265100550437565100490443065100550447971000380453483000540457285600570462685600920468399100043864970896620250701143949.0m        d        cr##n#########200915t20202020enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781800640184 (Hardback)  z9781800640177 (Paperback)  a9781800640191q(pdf)  a9781800640207q(epub)  a9781800640214q(mobi)  a9781800640221q(XML)  z2515-0758 (Print)  a2515-0766 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1229816898  aStSaULbengerda  aa-ii---1 aDinesh, Nandita,eauthor.10aChronicles from Kashmirh[electronic resource] :ban annotated, multimedia script /cNandita Dinesh. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (252 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aApplied theatre praxis seriesx2515-0766 ;vvol. 2  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Developed between 2013 and 2018 by the Ensemble Kashmir Theatre Akademi and Nandita Dinesh, the play uses a durational, promenade format to immerse its audience within a multitude of perspectives on life in Kashmir. From a wedding celebration that is interrupted by curfew, to schoolboys divided by policing strategies, and soldiers struggling with a toxic mixture of boredom and trauma, Chronicles from Kashmir uses performance, installation and collaborative creation to grapple with Kashmir's conflicts through the lenses of outsiders, insiders, and everyone in between. Due to varying degrees of censorship and suppression, the play has not been performed live since 2017. This book is, therefore, an attempt to keep Chronicles from Kashmir alive by including filmed scenes, a script, contextual questions, a glossary, and illuminating introductions by Nandita Dinesh and EKTA founder Bhawani Bashir Yasir. A valuable Open Access resource for practitioners, educators and students of performance and conflict, this book is also stimulating reading for anybody who has asked, 'What is happening in Kashmir?' This playscript includes: Twenty filmed scenes of the play in performance ; A range of contextual questions to stimulate discussion on staging site-adaptive theatre in places of conflict ; A helpful glossary."--Publisher's website. 0aKashmir, Vale of (India)xPolitics and government. 0aKashmir, Vale of (India)xSocial conditions. 0aKashmir, Vale of (India)xSocial life and customs.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aApplied theatre praxis series ;vv. 2.x2515-076640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0223zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0223.jpgzConnect to cover image03820nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022104000210024710000310026824501770029924600360047626400470051226400110055930000700057033600260064033700330066633700260069933800360072550000440076150600480080553800360085354001840088950400500107350503360112352014750145965000270293465000300296165000500299165000160304165000310305765000320308871000380312074000310315885600570318985600920324699100045859970896620250606154606.0m        d        cr##n#########240913t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111658 (hardback)  z9781805111641 (paperback)  a9781805111665q(pdf)  a9781805111696q(HTML)  a9781805111672q(epub)  aStSaULbengerda1 aRudy, Kathryn M.,eauthor.10aTouching parchmenth[electronic resource] :bhow medieval users rubbed, handled, and kissed their manuscripts.nVol. 2,pSocial encounters with the book /cKathryn M.

The traces of their use through touching and handling during different rituals such as oath-taking, public reading, and memorializing the dead, is the subject of Kathryn Rudy's research in Touching Parchment. This second volume, Social Encounters with the Book, delves into the physical interaction with books in various social settings, including education, courtly assemblies, and confraternal gatherings. Looking at acts such as pointing, scratching, and 'wet-touching', the author zooms in on smudges and abrasions on medieval manuscripts as testimonials of readers' interaction with the book and its contents. In so doing, she dissects the function of books in oaths, confraternal groups, education, and courtly settings, illuminating how books were used as teaching aids and tools for conveying political messages. The narrative paints a vivid picture of medieval reading, emphasizing bodily engagement, from page-turning to the intimate act of kissing pages. Overall, this text offers a captivating exploration of the tactile and social dimensions of book use in late medieval Europe broadening our perspective on the role of objects in rituals during the middle ages. Social Encounters with the Book provides a fundamental resource to anybody interested in medieval history and book materiality more widely."--Publisher's website. 0aBooksxSocial aspects. 0aBooksxHistoryy400-1450. 0aManuscripts, MedievalxHistory and criticism. 0aCodicology. 0aBooksxHistoryy1450-1600. 0aMaterial culturexResearch.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.0 aOfficials and their books.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0379zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0379.jpgzConnect to cover image04966nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026904100130029004300120030310000340031524502170034924600300056626400460059626400110064230000600065333600260071333700260073933800360076550000440080150600480084553800360089354001660092950001590109550400530125454600930130750509990140052016670239960000250406665000410409170000650413270000280419771000380422574000480426385600570431185600920436899100046335970896620250606154744.0m        d        cr##n#########240917 20242024enkad   s     001 0 eng d  z9781800649989 (Hardback)  z9781800649972 (Paperback)  a9781800649996q(pdf)  a9781805110033q(HTML)  a9781805110002q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1389616454  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghyid  ae-pl---1 aLeshchinsky, Yankev,eauthor.14aThe last years of Polish Jewry.nVolume 2,pThe permanent pogrom, 1935-37h[electronic resource] /cby Yankev Leshchinsky ; translated by Robert Brym and Eli Jany ; edited and with an introduction by Robert Brym.3 aPermanent pogrom, 1935-37 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2024. 4c©2024  a1 online resource (viii, 182 pages) :b8 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Known as "the dean of Jewish sociologists" and "the father of Jewish demography," Leshchinsky published a series of insightful and moving essays in Yiddish on Polish Jewry between 1927 and 1937. Despite heightened interest in interwar Jewish communities in Poland in recent years, these essays (like most of Leshchinsky's works) have never been translated into English. The Last Years of Polish Jewry helps to rectify this situation by translating some of Leshchinsky's key essays. A thoughtful Introduction by Robert Brym provides the context of the author's life and work. The essays in this volume, based on years of research and first-hand observation, focus on the period 1927-33. The rise of militant Polish nationalism and the ensuing anti-Jewish boycotts and pogroms; the increasing exclusion of Jews from government employment and the universities; the destitution, hunger, suicide, and efforts to emigrate that characterized Jewish life; the psychological toll taken by mass uncertainty and hopelessness-all this falls within the author's ambit. There is no work in English that comes close to the range and depth of Leshchinsky's essays on the last years of the three million Polish Jews who were to perish at the hand of the Nazi regime. This book will be of interest to researchers and students of Eastern European history and society, especially those with an interest in Eastern Europe's Jewish communities on the brink of the Holocaust."--Publisher's website.10aLeshchinsky, Yankev. 0aJewszPolandxHistoryy20th century.1 aBrym, Robert,etranslator,eeditor,ewriter of introduction.1 aJany, Eli,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.0 aAt the edge of the abyss : essays, 1927-33.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0342zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0342.jpgzConnect to cover image05493nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000260016102000260018702200220021302200230023503500210025804000210027910000310030024501070033126400470043826400110048530000340049633600260053033700260055633800360058249000510061850000440066950600480071353800360076154001650079750002140096250521750117652012080335165000450455965000430460465000400464765000400468765000450472771000380477283000510481085600580486185600920491999100046594970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         160211t20162016enk     s     000 0 eng d  z9781783741427 (pbk.)  a9781783741441q(pdf)  a9781783741458q(epub)  a9781783741465q(mobi)  z2397-1126 (Print)  a2397-1134 (Online)  a(OCoLC)938988868  aStSaULbengerda1 aSiklos, S.

STEP examinations are used by Cambridge colleges as the basis for conditional offers in mathematics and sometimes in other mathematics-related subjects. They are also used by Warwick University, and many other mathematics departments recommend that their applicants practice on past papers to become accustomed to university-style mathematics. Advanced Problems in Mathematics is recommended as preparation for any undergraduate mathematics course, even for students who do not plan to take the Sixth Term Examination Paper. The questions analysed in this book are all based on recent STEP questions selected to address the syllabus for Papers I and II, which is the A-level core (i.e. C1 to C4) with a few additions. Each question is followed by a comment and a full solution. The comments direct the reader's attention to key points and put the question in its true mathematical context. The solutions point students to the methodology required to address advanced mathematical problems critically and independently."--Publisher's website. 0aMathematicsxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aMathematicsvProblems, exercises, etc. 0aCalculusvProblems, exercises, etc. 0aGeometryvProblems, exercises, etc. 0aProbabilitiesxProblems, exercises, etc.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOBP series in mathematics ;vv. 1.x2387-1134 40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0075zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0075.jpgzConnect to cover image05062nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100130027410000270028724501280031426400470044226400110048930000410050033600260054133700260056733800360059349000670062950000440069650600480074053800360078854001660082450000700099050000920106050400550115250504670120754600340167452024460170865000270415465000280418165000290420971000750423871000380431383000560435185600570440785600920446499100049461970896620250606155037.0m     o  d        cr##n#########240920t20242024enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113515 (hbk.)  z9781805113508 (pbk.)  a9781805113522q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1456571506  aStSaULbengerda1 aengaheb1 aIsaksson, Bo,eauthor.14aThe verb in classical Hebrewh[electronic resource] :bthe linguistic reality behind the consecutive tenses /cBo Isaksson. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xviii, 731 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 27  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Did This Book Achieve Its Aim? A Summary / Bo Isaksson.  aEnglish with Hebrew examples.  a"The consecutive tenses are fundamental in all descriptions of Classical Hebrew grammar. They are even basic to the textbooks on Biblical Hebrew. Being fundamental in the verbal system, and part of any beginner's grammar, they pose a serious problem to a linguistic understanding of the verbal system, since grammars describe an alternation of 'forms' or 'tenses' in double pairs: wayyiqṭol alternates with its 'equivalent' qaṭal, and wə-qaṭal alternates with its 'equivalent' yiqṭol. This 'enigma' in the verbal system is handled in the book by recognising that the alternation of the consecutive tenses with other tenses, in the reality of the text, represents a linking of clauses. The 'consecutive tenses' are clause-types with a natural language connective wa- directly followed by a finite verbal morpheme, a type of clause that expressed continuity in the earliest stage of Semitic. The commonly held assumption that there is a special 'consecutive waw' is unwarranted. The use of the 'consecutive' clause-types in order to express discourse continuity indicates that Classical Hebrew has retained the old unmarked declarative word order of Semitic syntax. Seen in the light of recent research on the Tiberian reading tradition, the 'consecutive' wayyiqṭol can be analysed as a retention of the old Semitic past perfective *wa-yaqtul, which was pronounced wa-yiqṭol in Classical Hebrew. The 'consecutive' wə-qāṭal (pronounced wa-qaṭal in the classical language) constitutes the result of an internal Hebrew development into a construction (in the sense of Joan Bybee) already foreshadowed in the earliest Northwest Semitic languages. The book understands the 'consecutive tenses' as discourse continuity clauses, which typically form chains of main line clauses. Such chains can be interrupted by other types of clauses. This interruption is a clause linking that receives special attention in the interpretation of the Classical Hebrew verbal system. Chapter six presents a regenerated text linguistics founded on the new terminology. A clause linking approach is the central methodological procedure in this book. To this must be added diachronic typology in a comparative Semitic setting. The linguistic examples of clause linking are gathered from a large Classical Hebrew corpus, the Pentateuch and the Book of Judges, and made searchable in a database of 6559 non-archaic text records."--Publisher's website. 0aHebrew languagexVerb. 0aHebrew languagexTense. 0aHebrw languagexClauses.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 27.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0414zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0414.jpgzConnect to cover image03640nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026810000260028924501150031526400470043026400110047730000380048833600260052633700260055233800360057850000440061450600480065853800360070654001680074250400520091050507770096252011710173965000280291065000160293865000260295465000390298071000380301985600570305785600920311499100053821970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         160308t20162016enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783741847 (Hardback)  z9781783741830 (Paperback)  a9781783741854q(pdf)  a9781783741861q(epub)  a9781783741878q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)946009512  aStSaULbengerda1 aTurri, John,eauthor.10aKnowledge and the norm of assertionh[electronic resource] :ban essay in philosophical science /cJohn Turri. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (x, 116 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Among its essential functions, language enables us to quickly and efficiently share information. We tell each other that many things are true-that is, we routinely make assertions. Information shared this way plays a critical role in the decisions and plans we make. In Knowledge and the Norm of Assertion, a distinguished philosopher and cognitive scientist investigates the rules or norms that structure our social practice of assertion. Combining evidence from philosophy, psychology, and biology, John Turri shows that knowledge is the central norm of assertion and explains why knowledge plays this role. Concise, comprehensive, non-technical, and thoroughly accessible, this volume quickly brings readers to the cutting edge of a major research program at the intersection of philosophy and science. It presupposes no philosophical or scientific training. It will be of interest to philosophers and scientists, is suitable for use in graduate and undergraduate courses, and will appeal to general readers interested in human nature, social cognition, and communication."--Publisher's website. 0aAssertion (Linguistics) 0aEpistemics. 0aKnowledge, Theory of. 0aLanguage and languagesxPhilosophy2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0083zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0083.jpgzConnect to cover image04594nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024501190028126400470040026400110044730000720045833600260053033700260055633800360058250000440061850600480066253800360071054001860074650000650093250400390099750515200103652011480255665000540370465000500375865000480380865000270385665000350388370000310391871000380394985600570398785600920404499100053932970896620250606155243.0m     o  d        cr##n#########240927t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113416 (hbk.)  z9781805113409 (pbk.)  a9781805113423q(pdf)  a9781805113447q(HTML)  a9781805113430q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1458588942  aStSaULbengerda00aUrban heritage and sustainability in the age of globalisationh[electronic resource] /cedited by Lilia Makhloufi. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xxvi, 302 pages) :b52 illustrations, 30 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

It sheds light on the stakes of heritage conservation, management and maintenance in today's globalised world. Through detailed studies of historic cities, the book explores both the tangible aspects of their built heritage (urban fabric, housing design, construction methods and materials for thermal comfort) and the intangible components of local communities (including identities, cultures, religions, values and ways of life) in diverse case studies in Egypt, France, India, Iran, Jordan, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia. By addressing not only urban and architectural heritage but also socio-cultural, environmental and political issues-including economic challenges and climatic concerns-this book is an essential resource for scholars and researchers across fields, including architecture, civil engineering, urban planning, sociology and philosophical anthropology."--Publisher's website. 0aHistoric buildingsxConservation and restoration. 0aHistoric sitesxConservation and restoration. 0aArchitecturexConservation and restoration. 0aHistoric preservation. 0aCultural propertyxProtection.1 aMakhloufi, Lilia,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0412zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0412.jpgzConnect to cover image03648nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500210027204000210029310000410031424501340035524600140048926400460050326400110054930000590056033600260061933700260064533800360067150000440070750600480075153800360079954001770083550400660101250504340107852014480151260000320296070000350299271000380302785600570306585600920312299100057758970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         201005t20202020enka    sb    000 0beng d  z9781800640061 (Hardback)  z9781800640054 (Paperback)  a9781800640078q(pdf)  a9781800640085q(epub)  a9781800640092q(mobi)  a9781800640108q(XML)  a(OCoLC)894506962  aStSaULbengerda1 aSharp, William,d1855-1905,eauthor.14aThe life and letters of William Sharp and "Fiona Macleod".nVolume III,p1900-1905h[electronic resource] /cWilliam F.

Sharp was a Scottish poet, novelist, biographer and editor who in 1893 began to write critically and commercially successful books under the name Fiona Macleod. This was far more than just a pseudonym: he corresponded as Macleod, enlisting his sister to provide the handwriting and address, and for more than a decade "Fiona Macleod" duped not only the general public but such literary luminaries as William Butler Yeats and, in America, E. C. Stedman. Sharp wrote "I feel another self within me now more than ever; it is as if I were possessed by a spirit who must speak out". This three-volume collection brings together Sharp's own correspondence - a fascinating trove in its own right, by a Victorian man of letters who was on intimate terms with writers including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Walter Pater, and George Meredith - and the Fiona Macleod letters, which bring to life Sharp's intriguing "second self". With an introduction and detailed notes by William F. Halloran, this richly rewarding collection offers a wonderful insight into the literary landscape of the time, while also investigating a strange and underappreciated phenomenon of late-nineteenth-century English literature. It is essential for scholars of the period, and it is an illuminating read for anyone interested in authorship and identity."--Publisher's website.10aSharp, William,d1855-1905.1 aHalloran, William F.,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0221zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0221.jpgzConnect to cover image04359nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404300130031524501210032826400460044926400110049530000620050633600260056833700260059433800360062050000440065650600480070053800360074854001650078450400410094950510100099052015040200065000190350465000370352365000480356065100270360865100350363570000320367071000380370285600570374085600920379799100057762970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         201005t20202020enka    sb    000 0ceng d  z9781783749881 (Hardback)  z9781783749874 (Paperback)  a9781783749898q(pdf)  a9781783749904q(epub)  a9781783749911q(azw3)  a9781783749928q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1241468683  aStSaULbengerda  as-gy--- 00aLiminal spacesh[electronic resource] :bmigration and women of the Guyanese diaspora /cedited by Grace Aneiza Ali. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (232 pages) :b72 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

It spans diverse inter-generational perspectives - from those who leave Guyana, and those who are left - and seven seminal decades of Guyana's history - from the 1950s to the present day - bringing the voices of women to the fore. The volume is conceived of as a visual exhibition on the page; a four-part journey navigating the contributors' essays and artworks, allowing the reader to trace the migration path of Guyanese women from their moment of departure, to their arrival on diasporic soils, to their reunion with Guyana. Eloquent and visually stunning, Liminal Spaces unpacks the global realities of migration, challenging and disrupting dominant narratives associated with Guyana, its colonial past, and its post-colonial present as a 'disappearing nation'. Multimodal in approach, the volume combines memoir, creative non-fiction, poetry, photography, art and curatorial essays to collectively examine the mutable notion of 'homeland', and grapple with ideas of place and accountability. This volume is a welcome contribution to the scholarly field of international migration, transnationalism, and diaspora, both in its creative methodological approach, and in its subject area - as one of the only studies published on Guyanese diaspora. It will be of great interest to those studying women and migration, and scholars and students of diaspora studies."--Publisher's website.  aWomenzGuyana. 0aWomen immigrantszGreat Britain. 0aEmigration and immigrationxSocial aspects. 0aGuyanaxHistoryy1966- 0aGuyanaxHistoryy20th century.1 aAli, Grace Aneiza,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0218zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0218.jpgzConnect to cover image04333nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017003500220019504000210021704100180023810000420025624501600029826400460045826400110050430000610051533600260057633700260060233800360062850000440066450600480070853800360075654001650079250200380095750400410099554600600103650002370109650506740133352014120200760000790341961000570349860000560355565000320361171000330364371000380367685600570371485600920377199100057780970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         201005s20202020enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783745760 (Hardback)  z9781783745753 (Paperback)  a9781783745777q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1225351699  aStSaULbengerda0 aengalatheng1 aBöckerman, Robin Wahlsten,eauthor.14aThe Bavarian commentary and Ovidh[electronic resource] :bClm 4610, the earliest documented commentary on the Metamorphoses /cRobin Wahlsten Böckerman. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (398 pages) :b4 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This commentary, which dates from around the year 1100 is the first systematic study of the Metamorphoses, founding a tradition of scholarly study that extends to the present day. Despite its significance, this medieval commentary has never before been published or analysed as a whole. Böckerman's groundbreaking work includes a critical edition of the entire manuscript, together with a lucid English translation and a rigorous and stimulating introduction, which sets the work in its historical, geographical and linguistic contexts with precision and clarity while offering a rigorous analysis of its form and function. The Bavarian Commentary and Ovid is essential reading for academics concerned with the reception of Ovid or that of other ancient authors. It will also be of great interest for Classical scholars, those investigating medieval commentaries and media history, and for anyone intrigued to know more about how the work of Ovid has echoed through history."--Publisher's website.00aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 or 18 A.D.tMetamorphosesxCriticism and interpretation.20aBayerische Staatsbibliothek.kManuscript.nClm 4610.00aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 or 18 A.D.xAppreciationzEurope. 0aLatin poetryxAppreciation.2 aBayerische Staatsbibliothek.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0154zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0154.jpgzConnect to cover image04225nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000260016102000260018703500220021304000210023510000410025624503000029726400470059726400110064430000610065533600260071633700260074233800360076850000440080450600480084853800360089654001960093250000650112850000440119350401060123750503400134352015340168365000140321765000220323170000400325370000280329370000300332170000350335170000310338670000340341770000320345170000370348371000380352085600570355885600920361599100062096970896620250606163721.0m     o  d        cr##n#########241007t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648074 (pbk.)  a9781800648098q(pdf)  a9781800648135q(HTML)  a9781800648104q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1464024025  aStSaULbengerda1 aClarke, Davidq(David Ian),eauthor.10aRāgs around the clockh[electronic resource] :ba handbook for North Indian classical music, with online recordings in the Khayāl style /cDavid Clarke ; music by Vijay Rajput with Murad Ali, Imre Bangha, Mahmood Dholpuri, Fida Hussain, Shahbaz Hussain, Jonathan Katz and Athar Hussain Khan. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xxiv, 238 pages) :b50 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work, including the music, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license.

Explorations and Analyses (II): Twilight Rāgs from North India / David Clarke.  a"Rāgs Around the Clock is a rich and vibrant compendium for the discovery and study of North Indian classical music. The theory and practice of rāg are explored through two interlinked resources: a handbook of essays and analyses offering technical, historical, cultural and aesthetic perspectives; and two online albums - Rāg samay cakra and Twilight Rāgs from North India - featuring khayāl singer Vijay Rajput and accompanists. Extracts from the albums are also embedded into the text to enhance learning and understanding. Each rāg is accompanied by a description of its chief characteristics and technical features, a notation of the song (bandiś) on which the performance is based, and a transliteration and translation of the song text. Distinctively, Rāg samay cakra also includes spoken renditions of each of the texts, helping non-Hindavi speakers to achieve the correct pronunciation. Sharing insights from both theory and practice, this collection draws on recent scholarship while also showcasing the vocal idiom - the gāyakī - of Vijay Rajput, a disciple of the late Pandit Bhimsen Joshi. It offers invaluable reading for students and researchers of Indian classical music, world music and ethnomusicology, and a rich repository for teacher and student practitioners of the khayāl vocal style. The combination of an aural and written exploration of rāg will appeal to anyone drawn to this form of music - whether newcomer, student (śiṣyā) or aficionado (rasika)."--Publisher's website. 0aKhayāl. 0aHindustani music.1 aRajput, Vijay,eeditor,eperformer.1 aAli, Murad,eperformer.1 aBangha, Imre,eperformer.1 aDholpuri, Mahmood,eperformer.1 aHussain, Fida,eperformer.1 aHussain, Shahbaz,eperformer.1 aKatz, Jonathan,eperformer.1 aKhan, Athar Hussain,eperformer.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0313zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0313.jpgzConnect to cover image03246nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031410000450033524500850038026400470046526400110051230000390052333600260056233700260058833800360061449000510065050000440070150600480074553800360079354001650082950504690099452010630146365000480252671000380257483000510261285600570266385600920272099100063179970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         160328t20162016enk     s     000 0 eng d  a9781783741380 (Hardback)  a9781783741373 (Paperback)  a9781783741397q(pdf)  a9781783741403q(epub)  a9781783741410q(mobi)  z2397-1126 (Print)  a2397-1134 (Online)  a(OCoLC)946613586   aStSaULbengerda1 aGardiner, A.q(Anthony),d1947-eauthor.10aTeaching mathematics at secondary levelh[electronic resource] /cTony Gardiner. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (xiv, 320 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOBP series in mathematicsx2387-1134 ;vvol. 2  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Arising in response to a limited National Curriculum, and engaged with secondary schooling for those aged 11  ̶ 14 (Key Stage 3) in particular, this handbook for teachers will help them broaden and enrich their students' mathematical education. It avoids specifying how to teach, and focuses instead on the central principles and concepts that need to be borne in mind by all teachers and textbook authors-but which are little appreciated in the UK at present. This study is aimed at anyone who would like to think more deeply about the discipline of 'elementary mathematics', in England and Wales and anywhere else. By analysing and supplementing the current curriculum, Teaching Mathematics provides food for thought for all those involved in school mathematics, whether as aspiring teachers or as experienced professionals. It challenges us all to reflect upon what it is that makes secondary school mathematics educationally, culturally, and socially important."--Publisher's website. 0aMathematicsxStudy and teaching (Secondary)2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOBP series in mathematics ;vv. 2.x2387-1134 40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0071zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0071.jpgzConnect to cover image08244nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031311000440033424502050037824600700058326400470065326400110070030000590071133600260077033700260079633800360082249000440085850000440090250600480094653800360099454001650103050540440119552019210523961000800716065000180724070000350725870000700729370000750736370000690743871000380750783000440754585600570758985600920764699100063871970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         160329t20162016enkc    s     000 0 eng d  z9781783742196 (Hardback)  z9781783742189 (Paperback)  a9781783742202q(pdf)  a9781783742219q(epub)  a9781783742226q(mobi)  z2399-6668 (Print)  a2399-6676 (Online)  a(OCoLC)946613621  aStSaULbengerda1 aGlobal Citizenship Commission,eauthor.14aThe universal declaration of human rights in the 21st centuryh[electronic resource] :ba living document in a changing world /ca report by the Global Citizenship Commission ; edited by Gordon Brown.33aUniversal declaration of human rights in the twenty-first century 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (x, 136 pages) ;bcolour portraits.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen reports seriesx2399-667 ;vvol. 2  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

The result - this volume - offers a 21st-century commentary on the original document, furthering the work of human rights and illuminating the ideal of global citizenship. What does it mean for each of us to be members of a global community?  Since 1948, the Declaration has stood as a beacon and a standard for a better world. Yet the work of making its ideals real is far from over. Hideous and systemic human rights abuses continue to be perpetrated at an alarming rate around the world. Too many people, particularly those in power, are hostile to human rights or indifferent to their claims. Meanwhile, our global interdependence deepens.   Bringing together world leaders and thinkers in the fields of politics, ethics, and philosophy, the Commission set out to develop a common understanding of the meaning of global citizenship - one that arises from basic human rights and empowers every individual in the world. This landmark report affirms the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and seeks to renew the 1948 enterprise, and the very ideal of the human family, for our day and generation. Members of the Global Citizenship Commission include: K. Anthony Appiah, Laurel Bellows, Nicolas Berggruen, Paul Boghossian, Gordon Brown (Chair), Craig Calhoun, Wang Chenguang, Mohamed ElBaradei, Fonna Forman, Andrew Forrest, Ronald M.

It presents a transcontinental engagement with his life and output, focusing as much on the impact of the questions he posed as on the accomplishments of his body of work. This volume evolved out of the multi-modal, international Meta-Xenakis Consortium's artistic and scholarly events commemorating his centenary. Informative and comprehensive, contributions span subjects including music composition, creative pedagogy, aesthetics, game theory, architecture, and the social and political contexts in which Xenakis operated. The book is organized in eight sections, centered on different facets of Xenakis's work and reception. It includes a digital archive of audio and visual media from the events staged throughout 2022, as well as computer software. Bringing into conversation the diverse perspectives and insights of researchers, musicians and artists, this volume serves as a foundational resource for future research on the life and work of Xenakis. It will be of interest to students, scholars, and practitioners across a range of disciplines including music, architecture, cybernetics and computation, and the digital arts."--Publisher's website.10aXenakis, Iannis,d1922-2001.10aXenakis, Iannis,d1922-2001xInfluence.10aXenakis, Iannis,d1922-2001xContributions in architecture.10aXenakis, Iannis,d1922-2001xContributions in mathematics.10aXenakis, Iannis,d1922-2001xAesthetics. 0aComposerszGreecey20th century.1 aKanach, Sharon E.,eeditor.1 aNelson, Peter,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0390zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0390.jpgzConnect to cover image03482nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000340028124501050031526400470042026400110046730000610047833600260053933700260056533800360059150000440062750600480067153800360071954002050075550400530096050504390101352012250145260000650267765000220274265000470276465000500281171000380286185600570289985600920295699100063964970896620250606155751.0m     o  d        cr##n#########241017t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113461 (hbk.)  z9781805113454 (pbk.)  a9781805113478q(pdf)  a9781805113492q(HTML)  a9781805113485q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1461946199  aStSaULbengerda1 aStead, Evanghélia,eauthor.10aGrotesque and performance in the art of Aubrey Beardsleyh[electronic resource] /cEvanghelia Stead. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xii, 280 pages) :b134 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- NoDerivs 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

This insightful study illuminates previously unexplored aspects of Aubrey Beardsley's relationship to the grotesque and his use of media, particularly his manipulation of the periodical press. For the first time and with keen intelligence, Evanghelia Stead fully reveals the aesthetic importance of Beardsley's Bon-Mots vignettes, as well as the relationship between Darwinism, his innovative foetus motif, and Decadence itself. Beautifully illustrated throughout, the book calls on histories of culture and aesthetics to show how the artist reworked traditional imagery and manipulated it beyond recognition-revealing for instance the influence of cathedral grotesques on Beardsley's own grotesque performances. Stead also demonstrates his major impact on Italian, French, American and German creative minds through the periodical press. Rich in original thought and detailed, comparative analysis, this book is an invigorating and enlightening read for scholars of Aubrey Beardsley, as well as for anyone interested in nineteenth-century visual culture, art history, art criticism, print culture, illustration, grotesque iconography, and cultural history."--Publisher's website.10aBeardsley, Aubrey,d1872-1898xCriticism and interpretation. 0aGrotesque in art. 0aCaricaturexSocial aspectszGreat Britain. 0aPrintszGreat BritainxHistory and criticism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0413zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0413.jpgzConnect to cover image06024nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202200220023802200230026003500220028304000210030524501590032626400470048526400110053230000680054333600260061133700260063733800360066349000740069950000440077350600480081753800360086554001660090150000400106750001160110750400500122350522000127352014700347365000300494365000400497370000320501370000340504571000640507971000380514371000320518171000380521383000940525185600570534585600920540299100064094970896620250606163619.0m     o  d        cr##n#########241018t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112853 (hbk.)  z9781805112846 (pbk.)  a9781805112860q(pdf)  a9781805112891q(HTML)  a9781805112877q(epub)  z2755-2632 (Print)  z2755-2640 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1460256915  aStSaULbengerda00aNouvelles études sur les lieux de spectacle de la première modernitéh[electronic resource] /cdirigé par Pauline Beaucé et Jeffrey M.

This edited volume delves into why modern philosophical approaches to technology closely align with phenomenology and explores the implications of this relationship. Over the past two decades, scholars have emphasized users' lived experiences and their interactions with technological practices, arguing that technologies gain meaning and shape within specific contexts, actively shaping those contexts in return. This book investigates the phenomenological roots of contemporary philosophy of technology, examining how phenomenology informs analyses of temporality, use, cognition, embodiment, and environmentality. Divided into three sections, the volume begins by exploring the role of phenomenological methods in the philosophy of technology, and further investigates the methodological implications of combining phenomenology with other philosophical schools. The second section examines technology as a phenomenon, debating whether it should be analysed as a whole or through individual artifacts. The final section addresses the practical applications of phenomenological insights in design practices and democratic engagement. By offering a systematic exploration of the connection between phenomenology and technology, this volume provides valuable insights for scholars, students, and researchers in related fields, highlighting the continued relevance of phenomenological perspectives in understanding our technologically mediated world."--Publisher's website. 0aTechnologyxPhilosophy. 0aTechnological innovationsxPhilosophy. 0aPhenomenology.1 aBoer, Bas de,eeditor.1 aZwier, Jochem,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0421zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0421.jpgzConnect to cover image04420nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304300120027424501640028626400470045026400110049730000710050833600260057933700260060533800360063149000670066750000440073450600480077853800360082654001660086250000700102850000920109850400500119050507460124052013780198665000460336465100370341065100420344770000310348970000300352070000340355071000750358471000380365983000560369785600570375385600920381099100064171970896620250606160128.0m     o  d        cr##n#########241018t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113386 (hbk.)  z9781805113379 (pbk.)  a9781805113393q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1463605613  aStSaULbengerda  aar-----00aDiversity across the Arabian Peninsulah[electronic resource] :blanguage, culture, nature /cedited by Fabio Gasparini, Kamala Russell and Janet C.

Ranging from history, field linguistics, and cultural studies these essays address the diversity of languages, ways of life, and natural environments that have marked the region throughout its history. The book stems from the intellectual exchange and collaboration fostered by a virtual workshop that met regularly in 2020-21 and which drew participants from within and beyond the academy. The contributions gathered in this volume highlight the need for a better understanding of a region that hosts a vast amount of culturally and linguistically diverse material, often in a precarious state of conservation. Diversity Across the Arabian Peninsula argues for the importance of holistic, community-based, and interdisciplinary approaches to linguistic endangerment and deep social and cultural changes: there is no documentation of language without attention to language use, the material lifeworld and its ecology, and social and cultural setting. Such research is enriched and made more impactful through collaboration with communities and scholars from the Global South. The essays in this volume thus spearhead a contextualized study of South Arabian linguistic varieties and their connection with the natural and cultural world they inhabit."--Publisher's website. 0aLanguage obsolescencezArabian Peninsula. 0aArabian PeninsulaxCivilization. 0aArabian PeninsulaxSocial conditions.1 aGasparini, Fabio,eeditor.1 aRussell, Kamala,eeditor.1 aWatson, Janet C.

What I said can't be true, for if it were, it would be false. So it must be false-but then it would be true after all. Attempts at a solution to this contradiction led such thinkers to develop their theories of meaning, reference and truth. A popular response, until it was attacked at length by Thomas Bradwardine in the early 1320s, was to dismiss such self-reference as impossible: no term (here, 'false') could refer to (or in medieval terms, "supposit for") a whole, e.g., a proposition, of which it is part. In light of Bradwardine's criticisms, Walter Segrave, writing around 1330, defended so-called restrictivism (restrictio) by claiming that such paradoxes exhibited a fallacy of accident. The classic example of this fallacy, the first of Aristotle's fallacies independent of language, is the Hidden Man puzzle: you know Coriscus, Coriscus is the one approaching, but you don't know the one approaching since, e.g., he is wearing a mask. But Aristotle's account is unclear and Segrave, building on ideas of Giles of Rome and Walter Burley, shows how the fallacy turns on an equivocation over the supposition of the middle term or one of the extremes in a syllogism. Thereby, Segrave is able to counter Bradwardine's arguments one by one and defend the restrictivist solution. In this volume, Segrave's text is edited from the three extant manuscripts, is translated into English, and is preceded by a substantial Introduction."--Publisher's website.10aSegrave, Walter.10aBradwardine, Thomas,d1290?-1349. 0aInsolubilia (Logic)xManuscripts. 0aParadoxxEarly works to 1800. 0aLogic, Medieval. 0aLogic, MedievalxEarly works to 1800.1 aBartocci, Barbara,d1984-eeditor,etranslator.1 aRead, Stephen,d1947-eeditor,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aMedieval text consortium series ;vv. 1.x2754-064240uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0359zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0359.jpgzConnect to cover image03692nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000270028124501550030826400470046326400110051030000370052133600260055833700260058433800360061050000440064650600480069053800360073854001840077450400510095850505740100952013140158365000400289765000490293765000460298665000390303271000380307185600570310985600920316699100076299970896620250606163503.0m     o  d        cr##n#########241107t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113751 (hbk.)  z9781805113744 (pbk.)  a9781805113768q(pdf)  a9781805113782q(HTML)  a9781805113775q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1467055515  aStSaULbengerda1 aLierman, Ash,eauthor.14aThe struggle you can't seeh[electronic resource] :bexperiences of neurodivergent and invisibly disabled students in higher education /cAsh Lierman. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (x, 272 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Grounded in principles of social justice and equity, this work draws from design thinking, the neurodiversity model, and Universal Design for Learning, to explore the context of higher education in relation to neurodivergent and disabled students. The author discusses findings from literature on the experiences of students with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, psychiatric disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, and disabling chronic physical illnesses. The inclusion of students with chronic illnesses is particularly timely, given the rising prevalence of long COVID symptoms and other lasting health impacts among university-aged individuals. Moreover Ash Lierman, who has extensive experience of serving students marginalized students, gives voice to this community, thus providing both a synthesis of existing research, and highlighting the needs and challenges of the students themselves. The Struggle You Can't See serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and support this underserved population, offering insights for transformational change in higher education."--Publisher's website. 0aCollege students with disabilities. 0aPeople with disabilitiesxEducation (Higher) 0aNeurodivergent peoplexEducation (Higher) 0aEducation, HigherxSocial aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0420zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0420.jpgzConnect to cover image05080nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300210028124501680030226400470047026400110051730000620052833600260059033700260061633800360064250000440067850600480072253800360077054001840080650000690099050400510105950517050111052013380281565000440415365000340419765000300423165000340426165100240429570000260431970000270434570000270437271000380439985600570443785600920449499100076470970896620250606160550.0m     o  d        cr##n#########241108t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113881 (hbk.)  z9781805113874 (pbk.)  a9781805112976q(pdf)  a9781805113904q(HTML)  a9781805113898q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1467055229  aStSaULbengerda  ai------au-at---00aDigital humanities in the India Rimh[electronic resource] :bcontemporary scholarship in Australia and India /cedited by Hart Cohen, Ujjwal Jana and Myra Gurney. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xviii, 354 pages) :b30 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

From the influence of Netflix on International Relations to contemporary digital adaptations of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, via detours into erobotics (empathic robots) and the cultural specificity of online dating, these essays convey the distinctive breadth and imagination of research in this field. Digital Humanities is a relatively new discipline in the India Rim, and this novelty has created space for innovative research ideas, as well as the use of traditional methodologies and software in different ways within these unique cultural spaces that could potentially influence how Digital Humanities is conceptualised internationally. For example, drawing on Indian classical logic leads to novel designs and applications of computation. This lively volume offers a fresh look at the Digital Humanities and an important overview of the work taking place in a region other than the Western countries that typically dominate the field. It has much to offer both experienced researchers and those new to the Digital Humanities."--Publisher's website. 0aDigital humanitiesxStudy and teaching. 0aDigital humanitiesxResearch. 0aEducation, HigherzIndia. 0aEducation, HigherzAustralia. 0aIndian Ocean Region1 aCohen, Hart,eeditor.1 aJana, Ujjwal,eeditor.1 aGurney, Myra,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0423zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0423.jpgzConnect to cover image04333nam a2200493 i 4500001001900000006001900019007001500038008004100053020002500094020002500119020002500144022002200169022002300191035002200214040002100236043001200257100003300269245009900302264004700401264001100448300003900459336002600498337002600524338003600550490006700586500004400653506004800697538003600745540016600781500007000947500009201017504006801109505088801177520133102065630004403396650003003440650002303470650002803493710007503521710003803596830005603634856005703690856009203747991000775739708966m     o  d        cr##n#########241115t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114369 (hbk.)  z9781805114352 (pbk.)  a9781805114376q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1468770545  aStSaULbengerda  aar-----1 aHornkohl, Aaron D.,eauthor.10aDiachronic diversity in classical biblical Hebrewh[electronic resource] /cAaron D.

Within this paradigm, the chronolectal unity of CBH is rarely questioned-this despite the reasonable expectation that the language of a corpus encompassing traditions of various ages and comprising works composed, edited, and transmitted over the course of centuries would show signs of diachronic development. From the perspective of historical evolution, CBH is remarkably homogenous. Within this apparent uniformity, however, there are indeed signs of historical development, sets of alternant features whose respective concentrations seem to divide CBH into two sub-chronolects. The most conspicuous typological division that emerges is between the CBH of the Pentateuch and that of the relevant Prophets and Writings. The present volume investigates a series of features that distinguish the two ostensible CBH sub-chronolects, weighs alternative explanations for distribution patterns that appear to have chronological significance, and considers broader implications for Hebrew diachrony and periodisation and for the composition of the Torah."--Publisher's website.00aBible.pOld TestamentxLanguage, style. 0aHebrew languagexGrammar. 0aLinguistic change. 0aHistorical linguistics.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 29.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0433zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0433.jpgzConnect to cover image03089nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016103500220018604000210020810000320022924501090026125000200037026400470039026400110043730000760044833600260052433700260055033800360057650000440061250600480065653800360070454001840074050000340092450400570095850504120101552009380142765000220236565000170238765000320240470000320243671000380246885600570250685600920256399100077618970896620250313114122.0m     o  d        cr  n         241115t20242024enkad   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805114598 (hbk.)  z9781805114581 (pbk.)  a9781805114604q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1431223605  aStSaULbengerda1 aRichter, Michael,eauthor. 10aNo prices no games!h[electronic resource] :bfour economic models /cMichael Richter, Ariel Rubinstein.  aSecond edition. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xi, 143 pages) :b13 colour illustrations, 7 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

A power relation according to which stronger agents are able to force weaker ones to do things against their will. 2. A norm that categorizes actions as permissible or forbidden. 3. A status relation over alternatives which limits each agent's choices. 4. Systematic biases in agents' preferences.  These four conventions are analysed using simple and mathematically straightforward models, without any pretensions regarding direct applied usefulness. While we do not advocate for the adoption of any of these conventions specifically - we do advocate that when modelling an economic situation, alternative equilibrium notions should be considered, rather than automatically reaching for the familiar approaches of prices or games."--Publisher's website. 0aEconomics models. 0aGame theory. 0aPricesxEconometric models.1 aRubinstein, Ariel,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0438zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0438.jpgzConnect to cover image03316nam a2200397 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000320028124500840031326400470039726400110044430000540045533600260050933700260053533800360056150000440059750600480064153800360068954001640072550400570088950503670094652013920131365000260270571000380273185600570276985600920282699100078168970896620250606163432.0m     o  d        cr##n#########241122t20242024enkd    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805113959 (hbk.)  z9781805113942 (pbk.)  a9781805113966q(pdf)  a9781805113980q(HTML)  a9781805113973q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1431223605  aStSaULbengerda1 aWeatherson, Brian,eauthor.10aKnowledgeh[electronic resource] :ba human interest story /cBrian Weatherson. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (viii, 276 pages) :b16 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

This means that what one knows is influenced not just by belief, evidence, and truth, but crucially by the purposes those beliefs serve. Drawing from classical Nyāya epistemologies, the book asserts that knowledge rationalizes action: if you know something, it is sensible to act on it-and the best way to square this with an anti-sceptical epistemology is to say that knowledge is interest-relative. While versions of this view have been debated, they haven't gained wide acceptance. The author addresses common objections with a refined formulation and explores how this perspective elucidates the role of knowledge in inquiry, daily life, and the history of thought. Key distinctions include the impact of "long odds" situations on knowledge, the distinctive role knowledge has a starting point for inquiry, and the importance of using non-ideal models in theorising about knowledge. Building on decades of scholarship, the author offers a cohesive theory that integrates and clarifies previous works, demonstrating that not only knowledge but also belief, rational belief, and evidence are interest-relative. This book is essential for those seeking a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between knowledge and practical interests."--Publisher's website. 0aKnowledge, Theory of.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0425zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0425.jpgzConnect to cover image06318nam a2200625 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031404100130033510000370034824501650038524600280055024600200057824600220059826400470062026400110066730000590067833600260073733700260076333800360078949000540082550000440087950600480092353800360097154001650100754002300117250400410140250516120144352018730305554600760492860000400500460000420504465000510508665000530513770000380519070000330522870000410526170000340530270000520533670000620538871000380545083000550548885600570554385600920560099100086150970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         160516t20162016enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783741632 (Hardback)  z9781783741625 (Paperback)  a9781783741649q(pdf)  a9781783741656q(epub)  a9781783741663q(mobi)  z2059-5743 (Print)  a2059-5751 (Online)  a(OCoLC)951659425   aStSaULbengerda1 aenghlat1 aTurpin, William,d1952-eauthor.10aOvid, Amores (Book 1)h[electronic resource] /cWilliam Turpin ; with contributions by Bart Huelsenbeck, Bret Mulligan, Christopher Francese, and JoAnne Miller.3 aOvid, Amores (Book one)3 aAmores (Book 1)3 aAmores (Book one) 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (264 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aDickinson College commentariesx2059-5743vvol. 2  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Ovid's Amores, written in the first century BC, is arguably the best-known and most popular collection in this tradition.  Born in 43 BC, Ovid was educated in Rome in preparation for a career in public services before finding his calling as a poet. He may have begun writing his Amores as early as 25 BC. Although influenced by poets such as Catullus, Ovid demonstrates a much greater awareness of the funny side of love than any of his predecessors. The Amores is a collection of romantic poems centered on the poet's own complicated love life: he is involved with a woman, Corinna, who is sometimes unobtainable, sometimes compliant, and often difficult and domineering. Whether as a literary trope, or perhaps merely as a human response to the problems of love in the real world, the principal focus of these poems is the poet himself, and his failures, foolishness, and delusions.  By the time he was in his forties, Ovid was Rome's most important living poet; his Metamorphoses, a kaleidoscopic epic poem about love and hatred among the gods and mortals, is one of the most admired and influential books of all time. In AD 8, Ovid was exiled by Augustus to Romania, for reasons that remain obscure. He died there in AD 17.  The Amores were originally published in five books, but reissued around 1 AD in their current three-book form. This edition of the first book of the collection contains the complete Latin text of Book 1, along with commentary, notes and full vocabulary. Both entertaining and thought-provoking, this book will provide an invaluable aid to students of Latin and general readers alike. This book contain embedded audio files of the original text read aloud by Aleksandra Szypowska.."--Publisher's website.   aText in Latin; introductory material, notes and translation in English.00aOvid,d 43 B.C.-17 A.D. or 18 A.D. 00aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 or 18 A.D.tAmores. 0aLove poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aErotic poetry, LatinvTranslations into English.1 aHuelsenbeck, Bart,econtributor. 1 aMulligan, Bretecontributor.1 aFrancese, Christopher,econtributor.1 aMiller, Joanne,econtributor.02aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 or 18 A.D.tAmores.nLiber 1.02aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 or 18 A.D.tAmores.nLiber 1.lEnglish.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aDickinson College commentaries ;vv. 2.x2059-574340uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0067zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0067.jpgzConnect to cover image08716nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026810000370028924501080032626400470043426400110048130000590049233600260055133700260057733800360060350000440063950600480068353800360073154001650076750400530093250551350098552016530612065000650777365000460783865000650788465000270794965000490797665000460802571000380807185600570810985600920816699100091087970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         160530t20162016enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742295 (Hardback)  z9781783742295 (Paperback)  a9781783742301q(pdf)  a9781783742318q(epub)  a9781783742325q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)951661155  aStSaULbengerda1 aAzam, Mohammad Monirul,eauthor.10aIntellectual property and public health in the developing worldh[electronic resource] /cMonirul Azam. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (348 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

In this timely and necessary book, Monirul Azam examines the attempts of several developing countries to walk this fine line. He evaluates the experiences of Brazil, China, India, and South Africa for lessons to guide Bangladesh and developing nations everywhere. Azam's legal expertise, concern for public welfare, and compelling grasp of principal case studies make Intellectual Property and Public Health in the Developing World a definitive work. The developing world is striving to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organization's TRIPS Agreement on intellectual property. This book sets out with lucidity and insight the background of the TRIPS Agreement and its implications for pharmaceutical patents, the consequences for developing countries, and the efforts of certain representative nations to comply with international stipulations while still maintaining local industry and public health. Azam then brings the weight of this research to bear on the particular case of Bangladesh, offering a number of specific policy recommendations for the Bangladeshi government-and for governments the world over. Intellectual Property and Public Health in the Developing World is a must-read for public policy-makers, academics and students, non-governmental organizations, and readers everywhere who are interested in making sure that developing nations meet the health care needs of their people."--Publisher's website.  0aPatent medicinesxLaw and legislationzDeveloping countries. 0aDrug accessibilityzDeveloping countries. 0aPharmaceutical industryzDeveloping countriesxCost control. 0aPharmaceutical policy. 0aIntellectual propertyzDeveloping countries. 0aIntellectual property (International law)2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0093zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0093.jpgzConnect to cover image04675nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026924501230029026400460041326400110045930000650047033600260053533700260056133800360058750000440062350600480066753800360071554001650075150400410091650510370095752017410199465000350373565000590377065000300382965000380385965000290389770000310392670000350395770000260399271000380401885600570405685600920411399100093421970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         201019s20202020enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783749034 (Hardback)  z9781783749027 (Paperback)  a9781783749041q(pdf)  a9781783749058q(epub)  a9781783749065q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1201692813  aStSaULbengerda00aIntroducing vigilant audiencesh[electronic resource] /cedited by Daniel Trottier, Rashid Gabdulhakov and Qian Huang. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (360 pages) :billustrations (some colour)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Longstanding forms of moral scrutiny and justice seeking are disseminated through our contemporary media landscape, and researchers are increasingly recognising the significance of societal impacts effected by digital media. The authors engage with a range of cross-disciplinary perspectives in order to explore the actions of a vigilant digital audience - denunciation, shaming, doxing - and to consider the role of the press and other public figures in supporting or contesting these activities. In turn, the volume illuminates several tensions underlying these justice seeking activities - from their capacity to reproduce categorical forms of discrimination, to the diverse motivations of the wider audiences who participate in vigilant denunciations. This timely volume presents thoughtful case studies drawn both from high-profile Anglo-American contexts, and from developments in regions that have received less coverage in English-language scholarship. It is distinctive in its focus on the contested boundary between policing and entertainment, and on the various contexts in which the desire to seek retribution converges with the desire to consume entertainment. Introducing Vigilant Audiences will be of great value to researchers and students of sociology, politics, criminology, critical security studies, and media and communication. It will be of further interest to those who wish to understand recent cases of citizen-led justice seeking in their global context."--Publisher's website. 0aDigital mediaxSocial aspects. 0aMass mediaxTechnological innovationsxSocial aspects. 0aInternetxSocial aspects. 0aDemocracyxCitizen participation. 0aPolitical participation.1 aTrottier, Daniel,eeditor.1 aGabdulhakov, Rashid,eeditor. 1 aHuang, Qian,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0200zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0200.jpgzConnect to cover image04409nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000330031524501390034824600260048724600210051326400460053426400110058030000620059133600260065333700260067933800360070550000440074150600480078553800360083354001650086950400550103450507300108952017670181965000370358665000220362365000550364565000520370071000380375285600570379085600920384799100096613970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         201102s20202020enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800640306 (Hardback)  z9781800640290 (Paperback)  a9781800640313q(pdf)  a9781800641044q(epub)  a9781800641051q(mobi)  a9781800641068q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1249232906  aStSaULbengerda1 aRobertson, Stephen,eauthor.10aBC, before computersh[electronic resource] :bon information technology from writing to the age of digital data /cStephen Robertson.3 aB C, before computers3 aBefore computers 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (170 pages) :b19 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

In contrast, Stephen Robertson's BC: Before Computers is a work which questions the idea that the mid-twentieth century saw a single moment of rupture. It is about all the things that we had to learn, invent, and understand - all the ways we had to evolve our thinking - before we could enter the information technology revolution of the second half of the twentieth century. Its focus ranges from the beginnings of data processing, right back to such originary forms of human technology as the development of writing systems, gathering a whole history of revolutionary moments in the development of information technologies into a single, although not linear narrative. Treading the line between philosophy and technical history, Robertson draws on his extensive technical knowledge to produce a text which is both thought-provoking and accessible to a wide range of readers. The book is wide in scope, exploring the development of technologies in such diverse areas as cryptography, visual art and music, and the postal system. Through all this, it does not simply aim to tell the story of computer developments but to show that those developments rely on a long history of humans creating technologies for increasingly sophisticated methods of manipulating information.  Through a clear structure and engaging style, it brings together a wealth of informative and conceptual explorations into the history of human technologies, and avoids assumptions about any prior knowledge on the part of the reader. As such the expert and the general reader alike will find it of interest."--Publisher's website. 0aInformation technologyxHistory. 0aWritingxHistory. 0aCommunicationxTechnological innovationsxHistory. 0aMass mediaxTechnological innovationsxHistory.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0225zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0225.jpgzConnect to cover image05856nam a2200649 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031304100130033410000310034724000300037824503330040824600200074125000290076126400470079026400110083730000970084833600260094533700260097133800360099749000520103350000440108550600480112953800360117754001790121350002060139250001210159850001580171950400410187750503190191852015580223752003480379553003300414354001710447354600320464460000500467670000290472670000360475570000350479170000290482671000840485571000380493974000370497783000430501485600570505785600920511499100100791970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         160716t20162016enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781909254916 (Hardback)  z9781909254909 (Paperback)  a9781909254923q(pdf)  a9781909254930q(epub)  a9781909254947q(mobi)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)957038376  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghfre1 aDiderot, Denis,d1713-178410aNeveu de Rameau.lEnglish00aDenis Diderot, Rameau's Nephewh[electronic resource] =bLe neveu de Rameau : a multi-media bilingual edition /cedited by Marian Hobson ; translated by Kate E.

They talk about chess, about genius, about good and evil, about music, they gossip about the society in which they move, one of extreme inequality, of corruption, of envy, and about the circle of hangers-on in which the down-and-out abides. The down-and-out from time to time is possessed with movements almost like spasms, in which he imitates, he gestures, he rants. And towards half past five, when the warning bell of the Opera sounds, they part, going their separate ways. Probably completed in 1772-73, Denis Diderot's Rameau's Nephew fascinated Goethe, Hegel, Engels and Freud in turn, achieving a literary-philosophical status that no other work by Diderot shares. This interactive, multi-media and bilingual edition offers a brand new translation of Diderot's famous dialogue, and it also gives the reader much more. Portraits and biographies of the numerous individuals mentioned in the text, from minor actresses to senior government officials, enable the reader to see the people Diderot describes, and provide a window onto the complex social and political context that forms the backdrop to the dialogue. Links to musical pieces specially selected by Pascal Duc and performed by students of the Conservatoire national supérieur de musique et de danse de Paris, illuminate the wider musical context of the work, enlarging it far beyond its now widely understood relation to opéra comique."--Publisher's website.  a"Musical Resources.

Starting with elementary concepts, it leads the reader towards aspects of current mathematical research.  The book explains how conceptual hurdles in the development of numbers and number systems were overcome in the course of history, from Babylon to Classical Greece, from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, and so to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. he narrative moves from the Pythagorean insistence on positive multiples to the gradual acceptance of negative numbers, irrationals and complex numbers as essential tools in quantitative analysis. Within this chronological framework, chapters are organised thematically, covering a variety of topics and contexts: writing and solving equations, geometric construction, coordinates and complex numbers, perceptions of 'infinity' and its permissible uses in mathematics, number systems, and evolving views of the role of axioms. Through this approach, the author demonstrates that changes in our understanding of numbers have often relied on the breaking of long-held conventions to make way for new inventions at once providing greater clarity and widening mathematical horizons. Viewed from this historical perspective, mathematical abstraction emerges as neither mysterious nor immutable, but as a contingent, developing human activity. Making up Numbers will be of great interest to undergraduate and A-level students of mathematics, as well as secondary school teachers of the subject. In virtue of its detailed treatment of mathematical ideas, it will be of value to anyone seeking to learn more about the development of the subject."--Publisher's website. 0aMathematicsxResearch. 0aArithmeticxResearch. 0aNumbers, Natural. 0aNumbers, Real.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0236zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0236.jpgzConnect to cover image04052nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000240016102000250018502000250021002000240023503500220025904000210028110000280030224500800033026400460041026400110045630000590046733600260052633700260055233800360057850000440061450600480065853800360070654001650074250400600090750512890096752011100225660000520336665000250341871000380344385600570348185600920353899100104791970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         201117t20202020enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800640542 (hbk.)  z9781800640535 (pbk.)  a9781800640559 (pdf)  a9781800640566 (epub)  a9781800640573 (mobi)  z9781800640580 (XML)  a(OCoLC)1224367844  aStSaULbengerda1 aMcAleer, Sean,eauthor.10aPlato's Republich[electronic resource] :ban introduction /cSean McAleer. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (350 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

In its illumination of the philosophical ideas underpinning the work, it provides readers with an understanding and appreciation of the complexity and literary artistry of Plato's Republic. McAleer not only unpacks the key overarching questions of the text - What is justice? And Is a just life happier than an unjust life? - but also highlights some fascinating, overlooked passages which contribute to our understanding of Plato's philosophical thought. Plato's 'Republic': An Introduction offers a rigorous and thought-provoking analysis of the text, helping readers navigate one of the world's most influential works of philosophy and political theory. With its approachable tone and clear presentation, it constitutes a welcome contribution to the field, and will be an indispensable resource for philosophy students and teachers, as well as general readers new to, or returning to, the text."--Publisher's website.00aPlato.tRepublicxCriticism and interpretation. 0aPhilosophy, Ancient.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0229zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0229.jpgzConnect to cover image05145nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000240011102000250013502000240016002000250018402000250020902000240023403500220025804000210028004100130030110000310031424501080034526400460045326400110049930000350051033600260054533700260057133800360059750000440063350600480067753800360072554001650076150400530092654600590097950512680103852017670230660000620407360000450413560001290418065000380430970001290434771000380447685600570451485600920457199100104797970896620250313114128.0m        d        cr  n         201117t20202020enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z978178374897 (hbk.)  z9781783748969 (pbk.)  a9781783748983 (pdf)  a9781783748990 (epub)  a9781783749003 (mobi)  z9781783749010 (XML)  a(OCoLC)1222933113  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghfre1 aWarman, Caroline,eauthor.14aThe atheist's bibleh[electronic resource] :bDiderot's Éléments de physiologie /cCaroline Warman. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (442 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

In this late work, Diderot delves playfully into the relationship between bodily sensation, emotion and perception, and asks his readers what it means to be human in the absence of a soul. The Atheist's Bible challenges prevailing scholarly views on Diderot's Éléments, asserting its contemporary philosophical importance, and prompting its readers to inspect more closely this little-known and little-studied work. In this timely volume, Warman establishes the place of Diderot's Éléments in the trajectory of materialist theories of nature and the mind stretching back to Epicurus and Lucretius, and explores the fascinating reasons behind scholarly neglect of this seminal work. In turn, Warman outlines the hitherto unacknowledged dissemination and reception of Diderot's Éléments, demonstrating how Diderot's Éléments was circulated in manuscript-form as early as the 1790s, thus showing how the text came to influence the next generations of materialist thinkers. This book is accompanied by a digital edition of Jacques-André Naigeon's Mémoires historiques et philosophiques sur la vie et les ouvrages de Denis Diderot (1823), a work which, Warman argues, represents the first publication of Diderot's Éléments, long before its official publication date of 1875. The Atheist's Bible constitutes a major contribution to the field of Diderot studies, and will be of further interest to scholars and students of materialist natural philosophy in the Age of Enlightenment and beyond."--Publisher's website.10aDiderot, Denis,d1713-1784.tÉléments de physiologie.10aDiderot, Denis,d1713-1784.xPhilosophy.10aNaigeon, Jacques-André,d1738-1810.tMémoires historiques et philosophiques sur la vie et les ouvrages de Denis Diderot. 0aPhysiologyvEarly works to 1800. 12aNaigeon, Jacques-André,d1738-1810.tMémoires historiques et philosophiques sur la vie et les ouvrages de Denis Diderot.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0199zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0199.jpgzConnect to cover image04344nam a2200553 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031404100130033510000460034824000340039424501500042826400460057826400110062430000610063533600260069633700260072233800360074849000520078450000440083650600480088053800360092854001650096450000530112950400540118250502810123652016310151754600830314860000510323160000640328260000460334665100540339270000690344670000440351571000380355983000440359785600570364185600920369899100104983970896620250313114128.0m     o  d        cr  n         201119t20202020enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783749829 (Hardback)  z9781783749812 (Paperback)  a9781783749836q(pdf)  a9781783749843q(epub)  a9781783749850q(mobi)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1224019728  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghger1 aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805,eauthor.10aMaria Stuart.lEnglish.f202010aMaria Stuarth[electronic resource] /cby Friedrich Schiller ; translation and notes to the text by Flora Kimmich ; introduction by Roger Paulin. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (138 pages) :b6 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen Book classics seriesx2054-2178 ;vvol. 12  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Hope for and doubt about Mary's deliverance grow in the first two acts, given to the Scottish and the English queen respectively, reach crisis at the center of the play, where the two queens meet in a famous scene in a castle park, and die away in acts four and five, as the action advances to its inevitable end. The play is at once classical tragedy of great fineness, costume drama of the highest order-a spectacle on the stage-and one of the great moments in the long tradition of classical rhetoric, as Elizabeth's ministers argue for and against execution of a royal prisoner. Flora Kimmich's new translation carefully preserves the spirit of the original: the pathos and passion of Mary in captivity, the high seriousness of Elizabeth's ministers in council, and the robust comedy of that queen's untidy private life. Notes to the text identify the many historical figures who appear in the text, describe the political setting of the action, and draw attention to the structure of the play. Roger Paulin's introduction discusses the many threads of the conflict in Maria Stuart and enriches our understanding of this much-loved, much-produced play. Maria Stuart is the last of a series of five new translations of Schiller's major plays, accompanied by notes to the text and an authoritative introduction."--Publisher's website.  aText translated from the German ; translation and editorial matter in English.10aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805.tMaria Stuart10aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805vTranslations into English.00aMary,cQueen of Scots,d1542-1587xDrama.  aScotlandxHistoryyMary Stuart, 1542-1567vDrama.1 aKimmich, Flora,d1939-etranslator,ewriter of added commentary.1 aPaulin, Roger,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen Book classics ;vv. 12.x2054-217840uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0217zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0217.jpgzConnect to cover image08015nam a2200577 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000280011102000300013902000250016902000260019402000260022002000250024603500220027104000210029324503720031426400460068626400110073230000350074333600260077833700260080433800360083049000480086650000440091450600480095853800360100654001650104250000200120750538590122752016480508665000270673465000260676165000310678770000320681870000360685070000320688670000320691870000330695070000370698370000300702070000320705070000340708270000480711670000370716471000380720183000490723985600570728885600920734599100108420970896620250425120327.0m        d        cr##n#########201210t20202020enk     s     001 0 eng d  z9781800640788(Hardback)  z9781800640771 (Paperback)  a9781800640795q(pdf)  a9781800640801q(epub)  a9781800640818q(mobi)  a9781800640825q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1231606755  aStSaULbengerda00aTerrestrial mammal conservation :bglobal evidence for the effects of interventions for terrestrial mammals excluding bats and primatesh[electronic resource] /cNick A.

Over the course of fifteen chapters, the authors consider interventions as wide ranging as creating uncultivated margins around fields, prescribed burning, setting hunting quotas and removing non-native mammals. This book is written in an accessible style and is designed to be an invaluable resource for anyone concerned with the practical conservation of terrestrial mammals. The authors consulted an international group of terrestrial mammal experts and conservationists to produce this synopsis. Funding was provided by the MAVA Foundation, Arcadia and National Geographic Big Cats Initiative. Terrestrial Mammal Conservation is the seventeenth publication in the Conservation Evidence Series, linked to the online resource www.ConservationEvidence.com. Conservation Evidence Synopses are designed to promote a more evidence-based approach to biodiversity conservation. Others in the series include Bat Conservation, Primate Conservation, Bird Conservation and Forest Conservation and more are in preparation. Expert assessment of the evidence summarised within synopses is provided online and within the annual publication What Works in Conservation."--Publisher's website. 0aMammalsxConservation. 0aHabitat conservation. 0aBiodiversity conservation.1 aLittlewood, N.

Why did some critics react so harshly? Who were they and what biases and prejudices animated them? When did their antagonistic attitude change? And why did opera managers continue to produce Verdi's operas, in spite of their alleged worthlessness?  Massimo Zicari's Verdi in Victorian London reconstructs the reception of Verdi's operas in London from 1844, when a first critical account was published in the pages of The Athenaeum, to 1901, when Verdi's death received extensive tribute in The Musical Times. In the 1840s, certain London journalists were positively hostile towards the most talked-about representative of Italian opera, only to change their tune in the years to come. The supercilious critic of The Athenaeum, Henry Fothergill Chorley, declared that Verdi's melodies were worn, hackneyed and meaningless, his harmonies and progressions crude, his orchestration noisy. The scribes of The Times, The Musical World, The Illustrated London News, and The Musical Times all contributed to the critical hubbub. Yet by the 1850s, Victorian critics, however grudging, could neither deny nor ignore the popularity of Verdi's operas. Over the final three decades of the nineteenth century, moreover, London's musical milieu underwent changes of great magnitude, shifting the manner in which Verdi was conceptualized and making room for the powerful influence of Wagner. Nostalgic commentators began to lament the sad state of the Land of Song, referring to the now departed "palmy days of Italian opera." Zicari charts this entire cultural constellation. Verdi in Victorian London is required reading for both academics and opera aficionados. Music specialists will value a historical reconstruction that stems from a large body of first-hand source material, while Verdi lovers and Italian opera addicts will enjoy vivid analysis free from technical jargon. For students, scholars and plain readers alike, this book is an illuminating addition to the study of music reception."--Publisher's website. 10aVerdi, Giuseppe,d1813-1901xAppreciationzEnglandzLondon.10aVerdi, Giuseppe,d1813-1901xCriticism and interpretation. 0aOperaszEnglandy19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aMusiczEnglandzLondony19th century. 0aLondon (England)xIntellectual lifey19th century. 0aLondon (England)xSocial life and customsy19th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0090zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0090.jpgzConnect to cover image05494nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031324501490033426400470048326400110053030000590054133600260060033700260062633800360065249000490068850000440073750600480078153800360082954001650086550000530103050400530108350519630113652015210309965000360462065000310465665000300468765000200471770000260473771000380476383000500480185600570485185600920490899100109413970896620250313114128.0m        d        cr  n         160718t20162016enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742448 (Hardback)  z9781783742431 (Paperback)  a9781783742455q(pdf)  a9781783742462q(epub)  a9781783742479q(mobi)  z2059-4232 (Print)  a2059-4240 (Online)  a(OCoLC)953734585  aStSaULbengerda04aThe environment in the age of the Interneth[electronic resource] :bactivists, communication, and the digital landscape/cedited by Heike Graf. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (175 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aWhat works in conservation seriesx2059-4240  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Does this communication reveal and construct meaning? Is the environment expressed and foregrounded in the new landscape of digital media?  The Environment in the Age of the Internet is an interdisciplinary collection that draws together research and answers from media and communication studies, social sciences, modern history, and folklore studies. Edited by Heike Graf, its focus is on the communicative approaches taken by different groups to ecological issues, shedding light on how these groups tell their distinctive stories of "the environment". This book draws on case studies from around the world and focuses on activists of radically different kinds: protestors against pulp mills in South America, resistance to mining in the Sámi region of Sweden, the struggles of indigenous peoples from the Arctic to the Amazon, gardening bloggers in northern Europe, and neo-Nazi environmentalists in Germany. Each case is examined in relation to its multifaceted media coverage, mainstream and digital, professional and amateur. Stories are told within a context; examining the "what" and "how" of these environmental stories demonstrates how contexts determine communication, and how communication raises and shapes awareness. These issues have never been more urgent, this work never more timely. The Environment in the Age of the Internet is essential reading for everyone interested in how humans relate to their environment in the digital age."--Publisher's website.  0aEnvironmentalism in mass media. 0aEnvironment in mass media. 0aEnvironmental protection. 0aInternet users.1 aGraf, Heike,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWhat works in conservation series.x2059-424040uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0096zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0096.jpgzConnect to cover image04015nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031410000300033524500860036524600180045126400470046926400110051630000340052733600260056133700260058733800360061349000550064950000440070450600480074853800360079654001650083250400530099750501240105052019550117460000210312965000210315065000250317165000320319665000400322871000380326883000540330685600570336085600920341799100111549970896620250701124147.0m        d        cr##n#########160801t20162016enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742592 (Hardback)  z9781783742585 (Paperback)  a9781783742608q(pdf)  a9781783742615q(epub)  a9781783742622q(mobi)  z2515-0758 (Print)  a2515-0766 (Online)  a(OCoLC)957692063   aStSaULbengerda1 aDinesh, Nandita,eauthor.10aTheatre and warh[electronic resource] :bnotes from the field /cNandita Dinesh.34aTheatre & war 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (210 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aApplied theatre praxis seriesx2515-0766 ;vvol. 1  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This timely and important book weaves together Dinesh's personal narrative with the public story of modern conflict, illustrating as it does, the importance of theatre as a force for ethical deliberation and social justice. In it Dinesh asks how theatre might intervene in times and places of conflict and how we might reflect on such interventions. In pursuit of answers, Theatre and War adopts the methods of auto-ethnography, positioning the theatrical practitioner at the heart of conflict zones in northern Uganda, Guatemala, Northern Ireland, Mexico, Rwanda, Kenya, Nagaland, and Kashmir. No longer a detached observer, the researcher and practitioner has to be able to meld theory with practice; to speak to 'doing', without undervaluing the importance of 'thinking about doing'. Each chapter approaches the need for a synthesis of theory and practice by way of a term of inquiry-Why, Where, Who, What, When-and each is equipped with a set of unflinchingly honest field notes that are designed to reveal some of the 'hows' from the author's own repertoire: questions and issues that were encountered during her own theatrical undertakings, along with first hand reflection on the complexities, potential, and challenges that attended her global work in community theatre. Within these notes are strategies that give the reader a practical insight into how the discussion might find its footing on the ground of war. The range and scope of this book make it required reading for those interested in theatre-practitioners, researchers, and students alike-as well as those seeking to understand the applications of the arts for ethics, politics, and education."--Publisher's website.10aDinesh, Nandita. 0aWar and theater. 0aTheater and society. 0aTheaterxPolitical aspects. 0aPerforming artsxPolitical aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aApplied theatre praxis series ;vv. 1.x2515-076640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0099zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0099.jpgzConnect to cover image03490nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404100130031510000260032824501190035424600360047326400460050926400110055530000610056633600260062733700260065333800360067950000440071550600480075953800360080754001650084350000640100850501840107254600330125652012310128965000400252065000460256065000410260665000460264765000430269370000610273671000380279785600570283585600920289299100117955970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         201201s20202020enka    s     000 0aeng d  z9781800640849 (Hardback)  z9781800640832 (Paperback)  a9781800640856q(pdf)  a9781800640863q(epub)  a9781800640870q(mobi)  a9781800640887q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1325936339  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghyid1 aMann, Mendl,eauthor.14aThe Fall of Berlinh[electronic resource] /cMendl Mann ; translated and with an introduction by Maurice Wolfthal.33aMendl Mann's The fall of Berlin 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (250 pages) :b3 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Menakhem Isaacovich is a Polish Jew who, after fleeing the Nazis, finds refuge in the USSR. Translated into English from the original Yiddish by Maurice Wolfthal, the narrative follows Menakhem as he fights on the front line in Stalin's Red Army against Hitler and the Nazis who are destroying his homeland of Poland and exterminating the Jews. Menakhem encounters anti-Semitism on various occasions throughout the novel, and struggles to comprehend how seemingly normal people could hold such appalling views. As Mann writes, it is odd that "vicious, insidious anti-Semitism could reside in a person with elevated feelings, an average person, a decent person". The Fall of Berlin is both a striking and timelylook at the struggle that many Jewish soldiers faced. An affecting and unique book, which eloquently explores a variety of themes - such as anti-Semitism, patriotism, Stalinism and life as a Jewish soldier in the Second World War - this is essential reading for anyone interested in the Yiddish language, Jewish history, and the history of World War II."--Publisher's website. 0aJewish soldierszPolandvBiography. 0aJewish soldierszSoviet UnionvBiography. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xJewszPoland.  0aWorld War, 1939-1945xJewszSoviet Union. 0aHolocaust, Jewish (1939-1945)zPoland.1 aWolfthal, Maurice,etranslator,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0233zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0233.jpgzConnect to cover image04453nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024702200230027202200230029503500220031804000210034024501820036126400460054326400110058930000620060033600260066233700260068833800360071449000480075050000440079850600480084253800360089054001650092650400510109150509950114252012860213765000220342365000360344565000450348165000670352665000410359370000370363470000310367171000380370283000460374085600570378685600920384399100118468970896620250313114127.0m        d        cr  n         201216 20202020enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783749607 (Hardback)  z9781783749591 (Paperback)  a9781800641259q(pdf)  a9781783749386q(epub)  a9781783749409q(mobi)  a9781783749409q(XML)  z2634-7245 (Print)   a2634-7253 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1238564673  aStSaULbengerda00aGlobal warming in local discoursesh[electronic resource] :bhow communities around the world make sense of climate change /cedited by Michael Brüggemann and Simone Rödder. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (284 pages) :b12 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aGlobal communications.x2634-7253 ;vvol. 1  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This timely volume asks how local communities engage with these transnational discourses.  The chapters in this volume present a range of compelling case studies drawn from a broad cross-section of local communities around the world, reflecting diverse cultural and geographical contexts. From Greenland to northern Tanzania, it illuminates how different understandings evolve in diverse cultural and geographical contexts while also revealing some common patterns of how people make sense of climate change. Global Warming in Local Discourses constitutes a significant, new contribution to understanding the multi-perspectivity of our debates on climate change, further highlighting the need for interdisciplinary study within this area.  It will be a valuable resource to those studying climate and science communication; those interested in understanding the various roles played by journalism, NGOs, politics and science in shaping public understandings of climate change, as well as those exploring the intersections of the global and the local in debates on the sustainable transformation of societies."--Publisher's website. 0aClimatic changes. 0aClimatic changesvCase studies. 0aClimate change mitigationvCase studies. 0aClimate change mitigationzDeveloping countriesvCase studies. 0aGlobal warmingzDveloping countries.1 aBrüggemann, Michael,eeditor. 1 aRödder, Simone,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aGlobal communications ;vv. 1.x2634-725340uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0212zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0212.jpgzConnect to cover image10680nam a2200601 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000240017002000250019402000250021902200220024402200230026603500220028904000210031124501530033225000190048526400470050426400110055130000350056233600260059733700260062333800360064949000670068550000440075250600480079653800360084454001650088050000480104550000280109350564210112152017990754265000310934165000430937265000500941565000260946565000380949165000450952965000320957465000440960665000510965070000370970170000290973870000340976770000320980171000380983383000580987185600570992985600920998699100118472970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         201216t20202020enk     s     000 0 eng d  z9781783748341 (Hardback)  z9781783748334 (Paperback)  a9781783748358 (pdf)  a9781783748365 (epub)  a9781783748372 (mobi)  z2059-4232 (Print)  a2059-4240 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1244161458  aStSaULbengerda00aWhat works in conservationh[electronic resource].n2020 /cedited by William J.

Is prescribed burning in grasslands beneficial for bird conservation? Does livestock exclusion from degraded peatlands benefit peatland conservation? Is the provision of artificial shelters effective for subtidal benthic invertebrate conservation? Do wind turbine modifications reduce bat fatalities? Does adding topsoil increase the abundance of heathland plants? Are interventions to reduce road impacts on amphibians effective? Do herbicides control invasive parrot's feather? What Works in Conservation has been created to provide practitioners with answers to these and many other questions about practical conservation. This book provides an assessment of the effectiveness of conservation interventions based on summarized scientific evidence. The 2020 edition contains new material on mammals, birds, marine benthic invertebrates, bat conservation and wetlands. Other chapters cover practical global conservation of primates, peatlands, shrublands and heathlands, management of captive animals as well as an extended chapter on control of freshwater invasive species, the global conservation of amphibians, bats, birds and forests, conservation of European farmland biodiversity and some aspects of enhancing natural pest control, enhancing soil fertility and control of freshwater invasive species. It contains key results from the summarized evidence for each conservation intervention and an assessment of the effectiveness of each by international expert panels. The accompanying website www.conservationevidence.com describes each of the studies individually, and provides full references. This is the fifth edition of What Works in Conservation, which is revised on an annual basis."--Publisher's website. 0aBiodiversity conservation. 0aBiodiversity conservationxManagement. 0aBiodiversity conservationxGovernment policy. 0aHabitat conservation. 0aHabitat conservationxManagement. 0aHabitat conservationxGovernment policy. 0aEnvironmental conservation. 0aEnvironmental conservationxManagement. 0aEnvironmental conservationxGovernment policy.1 aSutherland, William J.,eeditor.1 aDicks, Lynn V.,eeditor.1 aPetrovan, Silviu O.,eeditor.1 aSmith, Rebecca K.,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWhat works in conservation series ;vv. 5.x2059-424040uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0191zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0191.jpgzConnect to cover image04841nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202200220023802200230026003500210028304000210030424501350032526400460046026400110050630000590051733600260057633700260060233800360062849000530066450000440071750600480076153800360080954001650084550400530101050512980106352014370236165000300379865000370382865000280386565000410389365000440393465000330397870000450401170000300405671000380408683000500412485600570417485600920423199100123210970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         160823t20162016enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742394 (hbk.)  z9781783742387 (pbk.)  a9781783742400q(pdf)  a9781783742417q(epub)  a9781783742424q(mobi)  z2054-2410 (Print)  z2054-2429 (Online)  a(OCoLC)957694357  aStSaULbengerda00aDigital scholarly editingh[electronic resource] :btheories and practices /cedited by Matthew James Driscoll and Elena Pierazzo. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2016. 4c©2016  a1 online resource (290 pages) :bcolour illustration.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 a[Digital humanities seriesx2054-2429 ;vvol. 4]  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Drawing together the work of established and emerging researchers, it gives pause at a crucial moment in the history of technology in order to offer a sustained reflection on the practices involved in producing, editing and reading digital scholarly editions-and the theories that underpin them. The unrelenting progress of computer technology has changed the nature of textual scholarship at the most fundamental level: the way editors and scholars work, the tools they use to do such work and the research questions they attempt to answer have all been affected. Each of the essays in Digital Scholarly Editing approaches these changes with a different methodological consideration in mind. Together, they make a compelling case for re-evaluating the foundation of the discipline-one that tests its assertions against manuscripts and printed works from across literary history, and the globe. The sheer breadth of Digital Scholarly Editing, along with its successful integration of theory and practice, help redefine a rapidly-changing field, as its firm grounding and future-looking ambit ensure the work will be an indispensable starting point for further scholarship. This collection is essential reading for editors, scholars, students and readers who are invested in the future of textual scholarship and the digital humanities."--Publisher's website.  0aEditingxData processing. 0aScholarly electronic publishing. 0aDigital mediaxEditing. 0aCriticism, TextualxData processing. 0aTransmission of textsxData processing. 0aHumanitiesxData processing.1 aDriscoll, Matthew James,d1954-eeditor.1 aPierazzo, Elena,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aDigital humanities series ;vv. 4.x2054-242940uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0095zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0095.jpgzConnect to cover image03892nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024702200220027202200230029403500220031704000210033910000430036024501440040326400460054726400110059330000610060433600260066533700260069133800360071749000490075350000440080250600480084653800360089454001650093050400410109550506520113652013010178865000290308965100280311865100310314671000380317783000460321585600570326185600920331899100127728970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         210114t20212021enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781800640429 (Hardback)  z9781800640412 (Paperback)  a9781800640436q(pdf)  a9781800640443q(epub)  a9781800640450q(mobi)  a9781800640467q(XML)  z2634-7245 (Print)  a2634-7253 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1246539376  aStSaULbengerda1 aSerwornoo, Michael Yao Wodui,eauthor.14aThe image of Africa in Ghana's pressh[electronic resource] :bthe influence of international news agencies /cMichael Yao Wodui Serwornoo. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2021. 4c©2021  a1 online resource (256 pages) :b6 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aGlobal communications.x2634-7253 ;vvol. 2.  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Identifying a problematic focus on the Western media in previous studies of the African media image, Serwornoo uses the Ghanaian press as a case study to explore the effects of centuries of Afro-pessimistic discourse in the foreign press on the continent's self-description. This study brings together a number of theoretical approaches, including newsworthiness, intermedia agenda setting, postcolonial theory and the hierarchy of influences, to question the processes underpinning the creation of media content. It is particularly innovative in its application of the methodological frameworks of ethnographic content analysis and ethnographic interview techniques to unveil the perspectives of journalists and editors. The Image of Africa in Ghana's Press presents a vital contribution of the highest academic standard to the growing literature surrounding Afro-pessimism and postcolonial studies. It will be of great value to scientists in the field of journalism studies, as well as researchers interested in the merging of journalism research, postcolonial studies, and ethnography."--Publisher's website. 0aPresszGhanaxInfluence. 0aAfricaxPress coverage. 0aAfricaxForeign relations.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aGlobal communications ;vv. 2.x2634-725340uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0227zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0227.jpgzConnect to cover image04518nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404300120031524501270032726400460045426400110050030000620051133600260057333600330059933700260063233800360065850000440069450600480073853800360078654001650082250400530098750510070104052015000204765000460354765000480359365000650364165000320370665100330373865100310377170000350380271000380383785600570387585600920393299100127771970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         210114t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783749157 (Hardback)  z9781783749140 (Paperback)  a9781783749164q(pdf)  a9781783749171q(epub)  a9781783749188q(mobi)  a9781783749195q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1230389563  aStSaULbengerda  ae-gw---00aPhotography in the Third Reichh[electronic resource] :bart, physiognomy and propaganda /cedited by Christopher Webster. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2021. 4c©2021  a1 online resource (310 pages) :b67 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

These photographers developed and implemented physiognomic and ethnographic photography, and, through a Selbstgleichschaltung (a self-co-ordination with the regime), continued to practice as photographers throughout the twelve years of the Third Reich. The volume explores, through photographic reproductions and accompanying analysis, diverse aspects of photography during the Third Reich, ranging from the influence of Modernism, the qualitative effect of propaganda photography, and the utilisation of technology such as colour film, to the photograph as ideological metaphor. With an emphasis on the idealised representation of the German body and the role of physiognomy within this representation, the book examines how select photographers created and developed a visual myth of the 'master race' and its antitheses under the auspices of the Nationalist Socialist state. Photography in the Third Reich approaches its historical source photographs as material culture, examining their production, construction and proliferation. This detailed and informative text will be a valuable resource not only to historians studying the Third Reich, but to scholars and students of film, history of art, politics, media studies, cultural studies and holocaust studies."--Publisher's website. 0aPhotographyzGermanyxHistoryy1933-1945. 0aPhotographerszGermanyxHistoryy1933-1945. 0aPhotographyxPolitical aspectszGermanyxHistoryy1933-1945. 0aNational socialism and art. 0aGermanyxHistoryy1933-1945. 0aGermanyxEthnic relations.1 aWebster, Christopher,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0202zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0202.jpgzConnect to cover image05109nam a2200553 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202200220023802200230026003500220028304000210030504100130032610000380033924000380037724501950041524600290061026400460063926400110068530000600069633600260075633700260078233800360080849000440084450000440088850600480093253800360098054001650101650400430118150509230122452016700214760000640381760000690388160000760395065000380402665000460406470001120411070001030422271000380432583000430436385600570440685600920446399100132995970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         160912t20162016enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783740833 (hbk.)  z9781783740826 (pbk.)  a9781783740840q(pdf)  a9781783740857q(epub)  a9781783740864q(mobi)  z2054-2437 (Print)  a2054-2445 (Online)  a(OCoLC)959329498   aStSaULbengerda1 aenghlat1 aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 A.D. or 18 A.D.10aMetamorphoses.nLiber 3.lEnglish10aOvid, Metamorphoses, 3.511-733h[electronic resource] :bLatin text with introduction, commentary, glossary of terms, vocabulary aid and study questions /cIngo Gildenhard and Andrew Zissos.3 aMetamorphoses, 3.511-733 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2016. 4c©2016  a1 online resource (260 pages) :bcolour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aClassics textbooksx2054-2445 ;vvol. 5  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Notwithstanding the warnings of the seer Tiresias and the cautionary tale of a character Acoetes (perhaps Bacchus in disguise), who tells of how the god once transformed a group of blasphemous sailors into dolphins, Pentheus refuses to acknowledge the divinity of Bacchus or allow his worship at Thebes. Enraged, yet curious to witness the orgiastic rites of the nascent cult, Pentheus conceals himself in a grove on Mt. Cithaeron near the locus of the ceremonies. But in the course of the rites he is spotted by the female participants who rush upon him in a delusional frenzy, his mother and sisters in the vanguard, and tear him limb from limb. The episode abounds in themes of abiding interest, not least the clash between the authoritarian personality of Pentheus, who embodies 'law and order', masculine prowess, and the martial ethos of his city, and Bacchus, a somewhat effeminate god of orgiastic excess, who revels in the delusional and the deceptive, the transgression of boundaries, and the blurring of gender distinctions. This course book offers a wide-ranging introduction, the original Latin text, study aids with vocabulary, and an extensive commentary. Designed to stretch and stimulate readers, Gildenhard and Zissos's incisive commentary will be of particular interest to students of Latin at AS and undergraduate level. It extends beyond detailed linguistic analysis to encourage critical engagement with Ovid's poetry and discussion of the most recent scholarly thought."--Publisher's website. 00aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 or 18 A.D.xCriticism and interpretation.00aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 or 18 A.D.tMetamorphosesxCriticism, Textual.00aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 or 18 A.D.tMetamorphosesvTranslations into English. 0aMetamorphosisxMythologyvPoetry. 0aFables, LatinvTranslations into English.1 aGildenhard, Ingo,d1970-ewriter of commentary,ewriter of introduction,ewriter of supplementary material.1 aZissos, Andrew,ewriter of commentary,ewriter of introduction,ewriter of supplementary material.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aClassics textbooks ;vv. 5.x2054-244540uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0073zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0073.jpgzConnect to cover image05405nam a2200601 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023802200240026302200230028703500220031004000210033204100130035324501280036626400470049426400110054130000530055233600260060533700260063133800360065749000660069350000440075950600480080353800360085154001650088750000700105250000920112250400510121450000380126550518280130352010460313165000220417765000320419965000310423165000290426265000390429165000380433065000550436870000290442370000340445271000750448671000380456183000550459985600570465485600920471199100135291970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         210128t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783749485 (hbk.)  z9781783749478 (pbk.)  a9781783749492q(pdf)  a9781783749492q(epub)  a9781783749515q(azw3)  a9781783749522q(XML)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1236994424  aStSaULbengerda0 aengasyr00aStudies in the grammar and lexicon of Neo-Aramaich[electronic resource] /cedited by Geoffrey Khan and Paul M.

Due to upheavals in the Middle East over the last one hundred years, thousands of speakers of Neo-Aramaic dialects have been forced to migrate from their homes or have perished in massacres. As a result, the dialects are now highly endangered. The dialects exhibit a remarkable diversity of structures. Moreover, the considerable depth of attestation of Aramaic from earlier periods provides evidence for pathways of change. For these reasons the research of Neo-Aramaic is of importance for more general fields of linguistics, in particular language typology and historical linguistics.  The papers in this volume represent the full range of research that is currently being carried out on Neo-Aramaic dialects. They advance the field in numerous ways. In order to allow linguists who are not specialists in Neo-Aramaic to benefit from the papers, the examples are fully glossed."--Publisher's website.  0aAramaic language. 0aAramaic languagexDialects. 0aAramaic languagexGrammar. 0aSyriac language, Modern. 0aSyriac language, ModernxDialects. 0aSyriac language, ModernxGrammar. 0aHistorical linguisticszMiddle EastvCase studies.1 aKhan, Geoffrey,eeditor.1 aNoorlander, Paul M.,eeditor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 5.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0209zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0209.jpgzConnect to cover image04303nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501690031526400460048426400110053030000620054133600260060333700260062933800360065550000440069150600480073553800360078354001650081950400530098450508580103752015450189565000280344065000350346865000250350365000280352865000260355670000310358270000330361371000380364685600570368485600920374199100135327970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr##n#########210128t20212021enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781800640368 (Hardback)  z9781800640351 (Paperback)  a9781800640375q(pdf)  a9781800640382q(epub)  a9781800640399q(mobi)  a9781800640405q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1233024341  aStSaULbengerda00aAcoustemologies in contacth[electronic resource] :bsounding subjects and modes of listening in early modernity /cedited by Emily Wilbourne and Suzanne G.

They examine how cultural configurations of sound impacted communication, comprehension, and the categorisation of people. Addressing questions of identity, difference, sound, and subjectivity in global early modernity, these authors share the conviction that the body itself is the most intimate of contact zones, and that the culturally contingent systems by which sounds made sense could be foreign to early modern listeners and to present day scholars. Drawing on a global range of archival evidence-from New France and New Spain, to the slave ships of the Middle Passage, to China, Europe, and the Mediterranean court environment-this collection challenges the privileged position of European acoustical practices within the discipline of global-historical musicology. The discussion of Black and non-European experiences demonstrates how the production of 'the canon' in the cosmopolitan centres of colonial empires was underpinned by processes of human exploitation and extraction of resources. As such, this text is a timely response to calls within the discipline to decolonise music history and to contextualise the canonical works of the European past. This volume is accessible to a wide and interdisciplinary audience, not only within musicology, but also to those interested in early modern global history, sound studies, race, and slavery."--Publisher's website. 0aSoundsxSocial aspects. 0aSoundsxPsychological aspects. 0aMusicxInfluence of. 0aMusic and anthropology. 0aMusicologyxResearch.1 aWilbourne, Emily,eeditor.1 aCusick, Suzanne G.,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0226zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0226.jpgzConnect to cover image04438nam a2200589 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404100130031510000560032824000330038424502410041726400460065826400110070430000610071533600260077633700260080233800360082850000440086450600480090853800360095654001650099250000560115750400430121350504450125652013960170154600830309760000610318065000250324165000500326665000550331670000560337170000300342770000320345770000330348970000340352270000330355670000310358970000410362071000380366185600570369985600920375699100135341970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         210129t20212021enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783749096 (Hardback)  z9781783749089 (Paperback)  a9781783749102q(pdf)  a9781783749119q(epub)  a9781783749126q(mobi)  a9781783749133q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1237038951  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghfre1 aPalissot de Montenoy, Charles,d1730-1814,eauthor.10aPhilosophes.lEnglish.f202114aThe Philosophesh[electronic resource] /cby Charles Palissot ; edited by Jessica Goodman & Olivier Ferret ; translated by Jessica Goodman, Caitlin Gray, Felicity Gush, Phoebe Jackson, Nina Ludekens, Rosie Rigby & Lorenzo Edwards-Jones. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2021. 4c©2021  a1 online resource (234 pages) :b3 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Les Philosophes emerged in the charged historical context of the pamphlet wars surrounding the publication of Diderot and d'Alembert's Encyclopédie, and delivered an oblique but acerbic criticism of the intellectuals of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, including the likes of Diderot and Rousseau. This book presents the first high-quality English translation of the play, including critical apparatus. The translation is based on Olivier Ferret's edition, and renders the text into iambic pentameter to preserve the character of the original. Adaptations are further provided of Ferret's introduction and notes. This masterful and highly accessible translation of Les Philosophes opens up this polemical text to a non-specialist audience. It will be a valuable resource to non-Francophone scholars and students working on the philosophical exchanges of the Enlightenment. Moreover, this translation - the result of a year-long project undertaken by Jessica Goodman with six of her undergraduate French students - expounds the value of collaboration between scholar and student, and, as such, provides a model for other language tutors embarking on translation projects with their students."--Publisher's website.  aText translated from the French ; translation and editorial matter in English.10aPalissot de Montenoy, Charles,d1730-1814.tPhilosophes. 0aPhilosophersvDrama. 0aFrench drama (Comedy)xHistory and criticism. 0aFrench dramay18th centuryxHistory and criticism.1 aGoodman, Jessica Mary,d1985-eeditor,etranslator.1 aFerret, Olivier,eeditor.1 aGray, Caitlin,etranslator.1 aGush, Felicity,etranslator.1 aJackson, Phoebe,etranslator.1 aLudekens, Nina,etranslator.1 aRigby, Rosie,etranslator.1 aEdwards-Jones, Lorenzo,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0201zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0201.jpgzConnect to cover image06846nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500210023804000210025910000310028024501160031126400460042726400110047330000640048433600260054833700260057433800360060050000440063650600480068053800360072854001650076450400550092950525820098452025200356665000500608665000160613665000320615265000410618471000380622585600570626385600920632099100135511970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         160920t20162016enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742349 (hbk.)  z9781783742332 (pbk.)  a9781783742356q(pdf)  a9781783742363q(epub)  a9781783742370q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)959535017  aStSaULbengerda1 aRudy, Kathryn M.,eauthor.10aPiety in piecesh[electronic resource] :bhow medieval readers customized their manuscripts /cKathryn M.

Made by highly specialised craftspeople (scribes, illuminators, book binders) with labour-intensive processes using exclusive and sometimes exotic materials (parchment made from dozens or hundreds of skins, inks and paints made from prized minerals, animals and plants), books were expensive and built to last. They usually outlived their owners. Rather than discard them when they were superseded, book owners found ways to update, amend and upcycle books or book parts. These activities accelerated in the fifteenth century. Most manuscripts made before 1390 were bespoke and made for a particular client, but those made after 1390 (especially books of hours) were increasingly made for an open market, in which the producer was not in direct contact with the buyer. Increased efficiency led to more generic products, which owners were motivated to personalise. It also led to more blank parchment in the book, for example, the backs of inserted miniatures and the blanks ends of textual components. Book buyers of the late fourteenth and throughout the fifteenth century still held onto the old connotations of manuscripts-that they were custom-made luxury items-even when the production had become impersonal. Owners consequently purchased books made for an open market and then personalised them, filling in the blank spaces, and even adding more components later. This would give them an affordable product, but one that still smacked of luxury and met their individual needs. They kept older books in circulation by amending them, attached items to generic books to make them more relevant and valuable, and added new prayers with escalating indulgences as the culture of salvation shifted. Rudy considers ways in which book owners adjusted the contents of their books from the simplest (add a marginal note, sew in a curtain) to the most complex (take the book apart, embellish the components with painted decoration, add more quires of parchment). By making sometimes extreme adjustments, book owners kept their books fashionable and emotionally relevant. This study explores the intersection of codicology and human desire. Rudy shows how increased modularisation of book making led to more standardisation but also to more opportunities for personalisation. She asks: What properties did parchment manuscripts have that printed books lacked? What are the interrelationships among technology, efficiency, skill loss and standardisation?"--Publisher's website.  0aManuscripts, MedievalxHistory and criticism. 0aCodicology. 0aMaterial culturexResearch. 0aBooks and readingxHistoryyTo 1500.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0094zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0094.jpgzConnect to cover image04124nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025504100180027610000410029424501730033526400470050826400110055530000590056633600260062533700260065133800360067749000660071350000440077950600480082353800360087154001650090750000700107250000920114250400550123454601030128950502340139252016040162665000280323065000550325871000750331371000380338883000550342685600570348185600920353899100137473970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         210202t20212021enkh    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800640337 (hbk.)  z9781800640320 (pbk.)  a9781800640344q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1237750547  aStSaULbengerda0 aenghsyraeng1 aMinov, Sergey,eauthor,etranslator.14aThe marvels found in the great cities and in the seas and on the islandsh[electronic resource] :ba representative of 'aǧā'ib literature in Syriac /cSergey Minov. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (214 pages) :b13 colour facsimiles.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 6  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Produced by an unknown East Syrian Christian author during the late medieval or early modern period, this work offers a loosely organized catalogue of marvellous events, phenomena, and objects, natural as well as human-made, found throughout the world. The Marvels is a unique composition in that it bears witness to the creative adoption by Syriac Christians of the paradoxographical literary mode of 'aǧā'ib that enjoyed great popularity among their Arabic- and Persian-speaking Muslim neighbours. In this composition, the East Syrian author blends together a number of different paradoxographical traditions: some inherited from the earlier Christian works in Syriac, such as the Alexander Romance, some borrowed directly or indirectly from Muslim geographical and other works, and some, apparently, circulating as a part of local oral lore.

The volume is both intra- and inter-textual in focus, ranging from perceptive analysis of individual scenes to the exploration of motifs across Austen's fiction. Full of astute connections, these lively discussions hinge on the study of human behaviour - from family relationships to sickness and hypochondria - highlighting Austen's artful literary techniques and her powers of human observation. Jane Austen: Reflections of a Reader by (the late) Nora Bartlett is a brilliant contribution to the field of Jane Austen studies, both in its accessible style (which preserves the oral register of the original lectures), and in its foregrounding of the reader in a warm, compelling and incisive conversation about Austen's works. As such, it will appeal widely to all lovers of Jane Austen, whether first-time readers, students or scholars."--Publisher's website.10aAusten, Jane,d1775-1817xCriticism and interpretation.1 aStabler, Jane,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0216zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0216.jpgzConnect to cover image03512nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028504300120030610000320031824501350035026400470048526400110053230000630054333600260060633700260063233800360065850000440069450600480073853800360078654001650082250400670098750508100105452009840186465000550284871000380290385600570294185600920299899100140519970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         210226t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800641082 (hbk.)  z9781800641075 (pbk.)  a9781800641099q(pdf)  a9781800641105q(epub)  a9781800641112q(mobi)  a9781800641129q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1240827908  aStSaULbengerda  an-us---1 aComrie, Andrew C.,eauthor.10aLike nobody's businessh[electronic resource] :ban insider's guide to how US university finances really work /cAndrew C.

From flagship public research universities to small, private liberal arts colleges, there are few aspects of these institutions associated with more confusion, myths or lack of understanding than how they fund themselves and function in the business of higher education. Using simple, approachable explanations supported by clear illustrations, this book takes the reader on an engaging and enlightening tour of how the money flows. How does the university really pay for itself? Why do tuition and fees rise so fast? Why do universities lose money on research? Do most donations go to athletics? Grounded in hard data, original analyses, and the practical experience of a seasoned administrator, this book provides refreshingly clear answers and comprehensive insights for anyone on or off campus who is interested in the business of the university: how it earns its money, how it spends it, and how it all works."--Publisher's website.  0aUniversities and collegeszUnited StatesxFinance.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0240zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0240.jpgzConnect to cover image03229nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500210023804000210025910000380028024501350031826400470045326400110050030000540051133600260056533700260059133800360061750000440065350600480069753800360074554001650078150400550094650504090100152009960141065000390240665000550244565000270250065000250252765000440255271000380259685600570263485600920269199100145218970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         161020t20162016enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742745 (hbk.)  z9781783742738 (pbk.)  a9781783742752q(pdf)  a9781783742769q(epub)  a9781783742776q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)969643362  aStSaULbengerda1 aEve, Martin Paul,d1986-eauthor.10aLiterature against criticismh[electronic resource] :buniversity English and contemporary fiction in conflict /cMartin Paul Eve. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (248 pages) :b1 illustration.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

As the number of hyper-knowledgeable literary fans grows, students and researchers in English departments waver between dismissing and harnessing voices outside the academy. Meanwhile, the role that the university plays in contemporary literary fiction is becoming increasingly complex and metafictional, moving far beyond the 'campus novel' of the mid-twentieth century. Martin Paul Eve's engaging and far-reaching study explores the novel's contribution to the ongoing displacement of cultural authority away from university English. Spanning the works of Jennifer Egan, Ishmael Reed, Tom McCarthy, Sarah Waters, Percival Everett, Roberto Bolaño and many others, Literature Against Criticism forces us to re-think our previous notions about the relationship between those who write literary fiction and those who critique it."--Publisher's website. 0aLiteraturexHistory and criticism. 0aPopular literaturezFrancexHistory and criticism. 0aCriticismxAuthorship. 0aFictionxAuthorship. 0aLiteraturexStudy and teaching (Higher)2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0102zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0102.jpgzConnect to cover image04769nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000330028124501180031426400460043226400110047830000550048933600260054433700260057033800360059650000440063250600480067653800360072454001650076050000230092550504570094852024420140561100470384765000540389465000560394865000730400465100590407771000380413685600570417485600920423199100152508970896620250313114128.0m        d        cr  n         161114t20162016enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742899 (hbk.)  z9781783742882 (pbk.)  a9781783742905q(pdf)  a9781783742912q(epub)  a9781783742929q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)966364592   aStSaULbengerda1 aGatten, Jeffrey N.,eauthor.10aWoodstock scholarshiph[electronic resource] :ban interdisciplinary annotated bibliography /cJeffrey N.

Scholars study the sociological, political, musical, and artistic impact of the event and use it as a cultural touchstone when exploring alternative perspectives or seeking clarity. This interdisciplinary annotated bibliography records the details of over 400 English-language resources on the Festival, including books, chapters, articles, websites, transcriptions and videos. Divided into six main subsections-Culture & Society, History, Biography, Music, Film, Arts & Literature-for ease of consultation Woodstock Scholarship sheds light on all facets of a key happening in our collective history. Throughout the 1960s, popular music became increasingly reflective and suggestive of the rising political and social consciousness of the youth culture. Examples can be seen in the development of the protest song genre within the folk music boom of the early Sixties and the marriage of lifestyle to music first reflected by The Beatles with fashion, followed by psychedelic music with the emerging drug culture. Woodstock was where these themes coalesced, thus becoming the defining and last great moment of the 1960s. However, Woodstock also represented an abundant amount of experiences and ideas and moments. Thus, when exploring the complicated accounts and numerous facets of America during the turbulent Sixties one discovers scholarship on the key subjects, such as the Vietnam War or the Civil Rights Movement, often considering and debating the importance, relevance, and epic nature of Woodstock. Multiple narratives emerge: a radical engagement of the hippie movement, an overt commercial exploitation of youth culture, a political statement. Woodstock scholarship does not stand alone as field of study, but it is at the cross-road of a number of disciplines-music history, cultural studies, sociology, arts and literature, media studies, politics and economics. Providing full bibliographical details and concise, informative annotation for each entry, Woodstock Scholarship is an essential tool for students, scholars, teachers, and librarians in all these areas, as well as for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of both the Woodstock Music and Art Fair phenomenon and of the confluence of music, commerce and politics."--Publisher's website.20aWoodstock FestivalxHistoryvBibliography. 0aRock musicxHistory and criticismvBibliography.  0aPopular musicxHistory and criticismvBibliography. 0aPopular culturezUnited StatesxHistoryy20th centuryvBibliography. 0aUnited StatesxSocial conditionsy1960-vBibliography.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0105zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0105.jpgzConnect to cover image04151nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202200220023802200230026003500210028304000210030424501960032526400460052126400110056730000380057833600260061633700260064233800360066849000450070450000440074950600480079353800360084154001650087750000840104250400530112650509230117952009100210265000310301265000270304365000330307065000490310365000470315270000270319971000920322671000720331871000380339083000440342885600570347285600920352999100154560970896620251211143854.0m        d        cr##n#########161121t20162016enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783742943 (hbk.)  z9781783742936 (pbk.)  a9781783742950q(pdf)  a9781783742967q(epub)  a9781783742974q(mobi)  z2399-6668 (Print)  a2399-6676 (Online)  a(OCoLC)969090506  aStSaULbengerda04aThe infrastructure finance challengeh[electronic resource] /ca report by the Working Group on Infrastructure Finance, Stern School of Business, New York University ; chaired by Ingo Walter. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2016. 4c©2016  a1 online resource (vi, 128 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen reports seriesx2399-6676 ;vvol. 3  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

There is widespread agreement that infrastructure is a key dimension of global development and that its impact reaches deep into the broader economy with important and multifaceted implications for social progress. At the same time, infrastructure finance is among the most complex and challenging areas in the global financial architecture.

It provides readers with an excellent introduction to the theory and practice of editing 'authorial texts' alongside an exploration of authorial philology in its cultural and conceptual architecture. The originality and distinction of this work lies in its clear systematization of a discipline whose autonomous status has only recently been recognised (at least in Italy), though its roots may extend back as far as Giorgio Pasquali. This pioneering volume offers both a methodical set of instructions on how to read critical editions, and a wide range of practical examples, expanding upon the conceptual and methodological apparatus laid out in the first two chapters. By presenting a thorough account of the historical and theoretical framework through which authorial philology developed, Paola Italia and Giulia Raboni successfully reconceptualize the authorial text as an ever-changing organism, subject to alteration and modification. What is Authorial Philology? will be of great didactic value to students and researchers alike, providing readers with a fuller understanding of the rationale behind different editing practices, and addressing both traditional and newer methods such as the use of the digital medium and its implications. Spanning the whole Italian tradition from Petrarch to Carlo Emilio Gadda, this ground-breaking volume provokes us to consider important questions concerning a text's dynamism, the extent to which an author is 'agentive', and, most crucially, about the very nature of what we read.

Reaching beyond classical western media system typologies, Arab Media Systems brings together contributions from experts in the field of media in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) to provide valuable insights into the heterogeneity of this region's media systems. It focuses on trends in government stances towards media, media ownership models, technological innovation, and the role of transnational mobility in shaping media structure and practices. Each chapter in the volume traces a specific country's media - from Lebanon to Morocco - and assesses its media system in terms of historical roots, political and legal frameworks, media economy and ownership patterns, technology and infrastructure, and social factors (including diversity and equality in gender, age, ethnicities, religions, and languages). This book is a welcome contribution to the field of media studies, constituting the only edited collection in recent years to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of Arab media systems. As such, it will be of great use to students and scholars in media, journalism and communication studies, as well as political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists with an interest in the MENA region."--Publisher's website.  0aMass mediazMiddle East. 0aMass mediazAfrica, North. 0aMass mediaxPolitical aspectszMiddle East. 0aMass mediaxPolitical aspectszAfrica, North. 0aMass media and culturezMiddle East. 0aMass media and culturezAfrica, North.1 aRichter, Carola,eeditor.1 aKozman, Claudia,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aGlobal communications ;vv. 3.x2634-725340uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0238zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0238.jpgzConnect to cover image06215nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000240016102000250018502000250021002200220023502200230025703500210028004000210030124501320032226401460045426400110060030000770061133600260068833700260071433800360074049000540077650000440083050600480087453800360092254001650095850400420112350400950116550400410126050519980130152018370329960000220513660000780515860000620523660000600529870000290535871000690538771000380545683000540549485600570554885600920560599100159819970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         161202t20162016enkac   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783741786 (hbk.)  z9781783741779 (pbk.)  a9781783741793 (pdf)  a9781783741809 (epub)  a9781783741816 (mobi)  z0278-7687 (print)  a2054-3611 (online)  a(OCoLC)969036407  aStSaULbengerda00aEssays in honour of Eamonn Cantwellh[electronic resource] :bYeats annual no. 20, a special number /cedited by Warwick Gould. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers in association with the Institute of English Studies School of Advanced Study, University of London,c2016. 4c©2016  a1 online resource (510 pages) :billustrations (some colour), portraits.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aYeats annualx2054-3611 ;vno. 20, special number  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

B. Yeats Lectures Series (2003-2008) by Roy Foster, Warwick Gould, John Kelly, Paul Muldoon, Bernard O'Donoghue and Helen Vendler. Those that were available in pamphlet form are now collectors' items, but here is the complete series.These revised essays cover such themes as Yeats and the Refrain, Yeats as a Love Poet, Yeats, Ireland and Europe, the puzzles he created and solved with his art of poetic sequences, and his long and crucial interaction with the emerging T. S. Eliot. The series was inaugurated by a study of Yeats and his Books, which marked the gift to the Boole Library, Cork, of Dr Eamonn Cantwell's collection of rare editions of books by Yeats (here catalogued by Crónán Ó Doibhlin). Many of the volume's fifty-six plates offer images of artists' designs and resulting first editions. This bibliographical theme is continued with Colin Smythe's census of surviving copies of Yeats's earliest separate publication, Mosada (1886) and a resultant piece by Warwick Gould on that dramatic poem's source in the legend of The Phantom Ship. John Kelly reveals Yeats's ghost-writing for Sarah Allgood; Geert Lernout discovers the source for Yeats's 'Tulka', Günther Schmigalle unearths his surprising connexions with American communist colonists in Virginia, while Deirdre Toomey edits some new letters to the French anarchist, Auguste Hamon-all providing new annotation for standard editions. The volume is rounded with review essays by Colin McDowell (on A Vision, and Berkeley, Hone and Yeats), shorter reviews of current studies by Michael Edwards, Jad Adams and Deirdre Toomey, and obituaries of Jon Stallworthy (Nicolas Barker) and Katharine Worth (Richard Cave)."--Publisher's website.10aCantwell, Eamonn.10aYeats, W.

Each vertical reading analyses three same-numbered cantos from the three canticles: Inferno i, Purgatorio i and Paradiso i; Inferno ii, Purgatorio ii and Paradiso ii; etc. Although scholars have suggested before that there are correspondences between same-numbered cantos that beg to be explored, this is the first time that the approach has been pursued in a systematic fashion across the poem. This collection - to be issued in three volumes - offers an unprecedented repertoire of vertical readings for the whole poem. As the first volume exemplifies, vertical reading not only articulates unexamined connections between the three canticles but also unlocks engaging new ways to enter into core concerns of the poem. The three volumes thereby provide an indispensable resource for scholars, students and enthusiasts of Dante. The volume has its origin in a series of thirty-three public lectures held in Trinity College, the University of Cambridge (2012-2016) which can be accessed at the Cambridge Vertical Readings in Dante's Comedy website."--Publisher's website.00aDante Alighieri,d1265-1321.tDivina commediaxCriticism and interpretation.00aDante Alighieri,d1265-1321.tDivina commediaxCriticism, Textual.1 aCorbett, George,eeditor.1 aWebb, Heather,d1976-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0100zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0100.jpgzConnect to cover image04377nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026924501410029026400460043126400110047730000410048833600260052933700260055533800360058150000440061750600480066153800360070954001650074550400530091050521850096352004150314865000300356365000240359365000270361765000390364470000340368370000270371771000380374485600570378285600920383999100164223970896620250313114129.0m        d        cr  n         161219t20162016enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742790 (Hardback)  z9781783742783 (Paperback)  a9781783742806q(pdf)  a9781783742813q(epub)  a9781783742820q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)969036388   aStSaULbengerda00aOpen educationh[electronic resource] :binternational persepectives in higher education /cedited by Patrick Blessinger and T.J.

This original edited volume takes William Blake's aphorism as a basis to explore how British Romantic literature creates its own sense of time. It considers Romantic poetry as embedded in and reflecting on the march of time, regarding it not merely as a reaction to the course of events between the late-eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries, but also as a form of creative engagement with history in the making. The authors offer a comprehensive overview of the question of time from a literary perspective, applying a diverse range of critical approaches to Romantic authors from William Blake and Percy Shelley to John Clare and Samuel Rodgers. Close readings uncover fresh insights into these authors and their works, including Frankenstein, the most familiar of Romantic texts.  Revising current thinking about periodisation, the authors explore how the Romantic poetics of time bears witness to the ruptures and dislocations at work within chronological time. They consider an array of topics, such as ecological time, futurity, operatic time, or the a-temporality of Venice. As well as surveying the Romantic canon's evolution over time, these essays approach it as a phenomenon unfolding across national borders. Romantic authors are compared with American or European counterparts including Beethoven, Irving, Nietzsche and Beckett. Romanticism and Time will be of great value to literary scholars and students working in Romantic Studies. It will be of further interest to philosophers and historians working on the connections between philosophy, history and literature during the nineteenth century."--Publisher's website.  0aEnglish literaturey18th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aEnglish literaturey19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aTime in literature. 0aRomanticisimzGreat Britain.1 aLaniel-Musitelli, Sophie,eeditor.1 aSabiron, Céline,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0232zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0232.jpgzConnect to cover image04945nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028524501390030626400470044526400110049230000620050333600260056533700260059133800360061750000440065350600480069753800360074554001770078150400510095850518090100952013380281865000110415665000240416765000210419170000450421270000550425771000380431285600570435085600920440799100168138970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         210412t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800641143 (hbk.)  z9781800641136 (pbk.)  a9781800641150q(pdf)  a9781800641167q(epub)  a9781800641174q(mobi)  a9781800641181q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1250080289  aStSaULbengerda00aClassical musich[electronic resource] :bcontemporary perspectives and challenges /cedited by Michael Beckerman and Paul Boghossian. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (252 pages) :b15 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International license (CC BY NC ND 4.0).

With insights drawn from leading composers, performers, academics, journalists, and arts administrators, special focus is placed on classical music's defining traditions, challenges and contemporary scope. Innovative in structure and approach, the volume comprises two parts. The first provides detailed analyses of issues central to classical music in the present day, including diversity, governance, the identity and perception of classical music, and the challenges facing the achievement of financial stability in non-profit arts organizations. The second part offers case studies, from Miami to Seoul, of the innovative ways in which some arts organizations have responded to the challenges analyzed in the first part. Introductory material, as well as several of the essays, provide some preliminary thoughts about the impact of the crisis year 2020 on the world of classical music.  Classical Music: Contemporary Perspectives and Challenges will be a valuable and engaging resource for all readers interested in the development of the arts and classical music, especially academics, arts administrators and organizers, and classical music practitioners and audiences."--Publisher's website.  0aMusic. 0aMusicxPerformance. 0aMusic audiences.1 aBeckerman, Michael Brim,d1951-eeditor.1 aBoghossian, Paul A.q(Paul Artin),d1957-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0242zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0242.jpgzConnect to cover image03358nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500230026304000210028610000440030724500810035126400470043226400110047930000540049033600260054433700260057033800360059650000440063250600480067653800360072454001650076050400530092550504830097852011120146160000760257365000270264965000610267671000380273785600570277585600920283299100168262970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         210413t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800641594 (hbk.)  z9781800641587 (pbk.)  a9781800641600q(pdf)  a9781800641617q(epub)  a9781800641624q(mobi)  a9781800641631q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1247659268   aStSaULbengerda1 aRoberts, Adamq(Adam Charles),eauthor.10aMiddlemarchh[electronic resource] :bepigraphs and mirrors /cAdam Roberts. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (160 pages) :b3 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Casaubon's obsession is a cautionary tale, but Adam Roberts nonetheless sees in him an invitation to take Eliot's use of epigraphy and allusion seriously, and this book is an attempt to do just that. Roberts considers the epigraph as a mirror that refracts the meaning of a text, and that thus carries important resonances for the way Eliot's novels generate their meanings. In this lively and provoking study, he tracks down those allusions and quotations that have hitherto gone unidentified by scholars, examining their relationship to the text in which they sit to unfurl a broader argument about the novel - both this novel, and the novel form itself. Middlemarch: Epigraphs and Mirrors is both a study of George Eliot and a meditation on the textuality of fiction. It is essential reading for specialists and students of George Eliot, the nineteenth century novel, and intertextuality. It will also richly reward anyone who has ever taken pleasure in Middlemarch."--Publisher's website. 10aEliot, George,d1819-1880.tMiddlemarchxCriticism and interpretation.  0aEpigraphs (Literature) 0aEnglish literaturey19th centuryxHistory and criticism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0249zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0249.jpgzConnect to cover image05445nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025524501260027626400470040226400110044930000580046033600260051833700260054433800360057049000700060650000440067650600480072053800360076854001650080450000700096950000920103950400510113150523010118252008800348365000440436365000290440770000330443670000290446971000750449871000380457371101360461183000550474785600570480285600920485999100169735970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         210416t20212021enkh    sb    101 0 eng d  z9781800641655 (hbk.)  z9781800641648 (pbk.)  a9781800641662q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1247662730  aStSaULbengerda00aNew perspectives in Biblical and Rabbinic Hebrewh[electronic resource] /cedited by Aaron D.

The aim of the conference was to build bridges between various strands of research in the field of Hebrew language studies that rarely meet, namely philologists working on Biblical Hebrew, philologists working on Rabbinic Hebrew and theoretical linguists. This volume is the published outcome of this initiative. It contains peer-reviewed papers in the fields of Biblical and Rabbinic Hebrew that advance the field by the philological investigation of primary sources and the application of cutting-edge linguistic theory. These include contributions by established scholars and by students and early career researchers."--Publisher's website.  0aHebrew languagexPhilologyvCongresses. 0aLinguisticsvCongresses.1 aHornkohl, Aaron D.,eeditor.1 aKhan, Geoffrey,eeditor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.2 aBiblical Hebrew and Rabbinic Hebrew: New Perspectives in Philology and Linguistics (Conference) d(2019 :cUniversity of Cambridge) 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 7.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0250zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0250.jpgzConnect to cover image03772nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028504300120030610000370031824501610035526400470051626400110056330000620057433600260063633700260066233800360068850000440072450600480076853800360081654001650085250000780101750400530109550505430114852012710169165000310296265000370299365000390303065100460306971000380311585600570315385600920321099100170686970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         210504t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800641273 (hbk.)  z9781800641266 (pbk.)  a9781800641280q(pdf)  a9781800641297q(epub)  a9781800641303q(mobi)  a9781800641310q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1246625319  aStSaULbengerda  as-ck---1 aBaker, Geoffrey,d1970-eauthor.10aRethinking social action through musich[electronic resource] :bthe search for coexistence and citizenship in Medellín's music schools /cGeoffrey Baker. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (476 pages) :b31 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This ground-breaking book examines the development of the Red de Escuelas de Música de Medellín (the Network of Music Schools of Medellín), a network of 27 schools founded in Colombia's second city in 1996 as a response to its reputation as the most dangerous city on Earth. Inspired by El Sistema, the foundational Venezuelan music education program, the Red is nonetheless markedly different: its history is one of multiple reinventions and a continual search to improve its educational offering and better realise its social goals. Its internal reflections and attempts at transformation shed valuable light on the past, present, and future of SATM. Based on a year of intensive fieldwork in Colombia and written by Geoffrey Baker, the author of El Sistema: Orchestrating Venezuela's Youth (2014), this important volume offers fresh insights on SATM and its evolution both in scholarship and in practice. It will be of interest to a very varied readership: employees and leaders of SATM programs; music educators; funders and policy-makers; and students and scholars of SATM, music education, ethnomusicology, and other related fields."--Publisher's website.  0aMusic and youthzColombia. 0aMusicxSocial aspectszColombia. 0aConservatories of musiczColombia. 0aMedellín (Colombia)xSocial conditions.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0243zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0243.jpgzConnect to cover image06895nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000270011102000250013802000250016302000270018802000260021502000250024103500220026604000210028824501710030926400470048026400110052730000620053833600260060033700260062633800360065250000440068850600480073253800360078054001650081650000780098150400390105950530210109852017840411965000270590365000370593065000490596765000450601665000540606170000280611570000300614370000400617371000380621385600570625185600930630899100170714970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         210504t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783749621z (hbk.)  z9781783749614 (pbk.)  a9781783749638q(pdf)  a9781783749645 q(epub)  a9781783749652q(mobi)  a9781783749669q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1250577094  aStSaULbengerda00aRight researchh[electronic resource] :bmodelling sustainable research practices in the Anthropocene /cedited by Chelsea Miya, Oliver Rossier and Geoffrey Rockwell. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (558 pages) :b96 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

The essays in this volume critically examine scholarly research practices in the age of the Anthropocene, and ask what accountability educators and researchers have in 'righting' their relationship to the environment. The volume further calls attention to the geographical, financial, legal and political barriers that might limit scholarly dialogue by excluding researchers from participating in traditional modes of scholarly conversation. As such, Right Research is a bold invitation to the academic community to rigorous self-reflection on what their research looks like, how it is conducted, and how it might be developed so as to increase accessibility and sustainability, and decrease carbon footprint. The volume follows a three-part structure that bridges conceptual and practical concerns: the first section challenges our assumptions about how sustainability is defined, measured and practiced; the second section showcases artist-researchers whose work engages with the impact of humans on our environment; while the third section investigates how academic spaces can model eco-conscious behaviour. This timely volume responds to an increased demand for environmentally sustainable research, and is outstanding not only in its interdisciplinarity, but its embrace of non-traditional formats, spanning academic articles, creative acts, personal reflections and dialogues. Right Research will be a valuable resource for educators and researchers interested in developing and hybridizing their scholarly communication formats in the face of the current climate crisis."--Publisher's website.  0aResearchxMethodology. 0aResearchxEnvironmental aspects. 0aScholarly publishingxEnvironmental aspects. 0aAcademic writingxEnvironmental aspects. 0aUniversities and collegesxEnvironmental aspects.1 aMiya, Chelsea,eeditor.1 aRossier, Oliver,eeditor.1 aRockwell, Geoffrey,d1959-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0213zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0213.jpgzConnect to cover image 05221nam a2200553 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023802200240026302200230028703500220031004000210033204100180035324501790037126400470055026400110059730000650060833600260067333700260069933800360072549000700076150000440083150600480087553800360092354001650095950000700112450000920119450400390128654600500132550516880137552011120306365000500417565000220422570000300424770000270427770000460430471000750435071000380442583000550446385600570451885600920457599100170737970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         210504t20212021enkh    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783749942 (hbk.)  z9781783749935 (pbk.)  a9781783749959q(pdf)  a9781783749966q(epub)  a9781783749973q(mobi)  a9781783749980q(XML)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1252413135  aStSaULbengerda0 aengghebgsyr00aDiversity and Rabbinizationh[electronic resource] :bJewish texts and societies between 400 and 1000 CE /cedited by Gavin McDowell, Ron Naiweld and Daniel Stökl Ben Ezra. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (504 pages) :billustrations (some colour)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;v[volume 8]  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Drawing on available textual and material evidence, the fourteen essays presented here, written by leading experts in their fields, span a significant chronological and geographical range and cover material that has not yet received sufficient attention in scholarship. The volume is divided into four parts. The first focuses on the vantage point of the synagogue; the second and third on non-rabbinic Judaism in, respectively, the Near East and Europe; the final part turns from diversity within Judaism to the process of "rabbinization" as represented in some unusual rabbinic texts. Diversity and Rabbinization is a welcome contribution to the historical study of Judaism in all its complexity. It presents fresh perspectives on critical questions and allows us to rethink the tension between multiplicity and unity in Judaism during the first millennium CE."--Publisher's website.  0aRabbinical literaturexHistory and criticism. 0aJudaismxHistory.1 aMcDowell, Gavin,eeditor.1 aNaiweld, Ron,eeditor.1 aStökl Ben Ezra, Daniel,d1970-eeditor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 8.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0219zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0219.jpgzConnect to cover image04144nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023802200240026302200230028703500220031004000210033204300120035310000320036524501230039726400470052026400110056730000610057833600260063933700260066533800360069150000440072750600480077153800360081954001650085550400530102050507140107352015890178760000230337661000420339961000460344171000380348785600570352585600920358299100170861970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         210506t20212021enkh    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800641532 (hbk.)  z9781800641525 (pbk.)  a9781800641549q(pdf)  a9781800641556q(epub)  a9781800641563q(mobi)  a9781800641570q(XML)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1251447207  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk---1 aYeandle, David N.,eauthor.12aA Victorian curateh[electronic resource] :ba study of the life and career of the Rev.

Dr John Hunt (1827-1907) was not a typical clergyman in the Victorian Church of England. He was Scottish, of lowly birth, and lacking both social connections and private means. He was also a witty and fluent intellectual, whose publications stood alongside the most eminent of his peers during a period when theology was being redefined in the light of Darwin's Origin of Species and other radical scientific advances. Hunt attracted notoriety and conflict as well as admiration and respect: he was the subject of articles in Punch and in the wider press concerning his clandestine dissection of a foetus in the crypt of a City church, while his Essay on Pantheism was proscribed by the Roman Catholic Church. He had many skirmishes with incumbents, both evangelical and catholic, and was dismissed from several of his curacies. This book analyses his career in London and St Ives (Cambs.) through the lens of his autobiographical narrative, Clergymen Made Scarce (1867). David Yeandle has examined a little-known copy of the text that includes manuscript annotations by Eliza Hunt, the wife of the author, which offer unique insight into the many anonymous and pseudonymous references in the text. A Victorian Curate: A Study of the Life and Career of the Rev. Dr John Hunt is an absorbing personal account of the corruption and turmoil in the Church of England at this time. It will appeal to anyone interested in this history, the relationship between science and religion in the nineteenth century, or the role of the curate in Victorian England."--Publisher's website. 10aHunt, John,d1827-20aChurch of EnglandxClergyvBiography.20aChurch of EnglandxHistoryy19th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0248zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0248.jpgzConnect to cover image07324nam a2200589 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000240017002000250019402000250021902200220024402200230026603500220028904000210031124501490033225000380048126400460051926400110056530000600057633600260063633700260066233800360068849000670072450000600079150000440085150600480089553800360094354001650097950534930114452013640463765000310600165000430603265000500607565000260612565000380615165000450618965000320623465000440626665000510631070000370636170000290639870000300642770000320645771000380648983000580652785600570658585600920664299100172139970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         170123t20172017enka    s     000 0 eng d  z9781783743094 (Hardback)  z9781783743087 (Paperback)  a9781783743100 (pdf)  a9781783743117 (epub)  a9781783743124 (mobi)  z2059-4232 (Print)  a2059-4240 (Online)  a(OCoLC)973230488   aStSaULbengerda00aWhat works in conservationh[electronic resource].n2017 /cedited by William J.

Is paying farmers to cover the costs of bird conservation measures effective?  Is using prescribed fire beneficial for young trees in forests?  Does translocating frogs benefit wild populations?  Is providing artificial roost structures for bats beneficial? What Works in Conservation has been created to provide practitioners with answers to these and many other questions about practical conservation. This book provides an assessment of the effectiveness of 763 conservation interventions based on summarized scientific evidence. Chapters cover the practical global conservation of amphibians, bats, birds and forests, conservation of European farmland biodiversity and some aspects of enhancing natural pest control, enhancing soil fertility and control of freshwater invasive species. It contains key results from the summarized evidence for each conservation intervention and an assessment of the effectiveness of each by international expert panels. The accompanying website www.conservationevidence.com describes each of the studies individually, and provides full references. This is the second edition of What Works in Conservation, which is revised on an annual basis.

In democratic societies there is widespread acknowledgment of the need to incorporate citizens' input in decision-making processes in more or less structured ways. But participatory decision making is balancing on the borders of inclusion, structure, precision and accuracy. To simply enable more participation will not yield enhanced democracy, and there is a clear need for more elaborated elicitation and decision analytical tools. This rigorous and thought-provoking volume draws on a stimulating variety of international case studies, from flood risk management in the Red River Delta of Vietnam, to the consideration of alternatives to gold mining in Roșia Montană in Transylvania, to the application of multi-criteria decision analysis in evaluating the impact of e-learning opportunities at Uganda's Makerere University. Editors Love Ekenberg (senior research scholar, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis [IIASA], Laxenburg, professor of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University), Karin Hansson (artist and research fellow, Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University), Mats Danielson (vice president and professor of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University, affiliate researcher, IIASA) and Göran Cars (professor of Societal Planning and Environment, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm) draw innovative collaborations between mathematics, social science, and the arts. They develop new problem formulations and solutions, with the aim of carrying decisions from agenda setting and problem awareness through to feasible courses of action by setting objectives, alternative generation, consequence assessments, and trade-off clarifications. As a result, this book is important new reading for decision makers in government, public administration and urban planning, as well as students and researchers in the fields of participatory democracy, urban planning, social policy, communication design, participatory art, decision theory, risk analysis and computer and systems sciences."--Publisher's website.  0aPolitical participationxEvaluation. 0aPolitical participationxTechnological innovations. 0aPolitical participationvCase studies. 0aPolitical participationxSocial aspects. 0aInformation technologyxPolitical aspects  0aInternet in public administrationvCase studies.1 aEkenberg, Love,eauthor.1 aHansson, Karin,eauthor.1 aDanielson, Mats,eauthor.1 aCars, Göran,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0108zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0108.jpgzConnect to cover image05544nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028524501550030626400470046126400110050830000620051933600260058133700260060733800360063350000440066950600480071353800360076154001650079750400390096250518830100152017650288465000330464965000430468265000340472565000740475970000360483370000300486971000380489985600570493785600920499499100172580970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         210517t20212021enkh    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800640993 (hbk.)  z9781800640986 (pbk.)  a9781800641006q(pdf)  a9781800641013q(epub)  a9781800641020q(mobi)  a9781800641037q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1251511980  aStSaULbengerda00aShaping the digital dissertationh[electronic resource] :bknowledge production in the arts and humanities /cedited by Virginia Kuhn and Anke Finger. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (290 pages) :b33 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Are interactive dissertations significantly different from their paper-based counterparts? What are the effects of digital projects on doctoral education? How does one choose and defend a digital dissertation? This book explores the wider implications of digital scholarship across institutional, geographic, and disciplinary divides. The volume is arranged in two sections: the first, written by senior scholars, addresses conceptual concerns regarding the direction and assessment of digital dissertations in the broader context of doctoral education. The second section consists of case studies by PhD students whose research resulted in a natively digital dissertation that they have successfully defended. These early-career researchers have been selected to represent a range of disciplines and institutions. Despite the profound effect of incorporated digital tools on dissertations, the literature concerning them is limited. This volume aims to provide a fresh, up-to-date view on the digital dissertation, considering the newest technological advances. It is especially relevant in the European context where digital dissertations, mostly in arts-based research, are more popular. Shaping the Digital Dissertation aims to provide insights, precedents and best practices to graduate students, doctoral advisors, institutional agents, and dissertation committees. As digital dissertations have a potential impact on the state of research as a whole, this edited collection will be a useful resource for the wider academic community and anyone interested in the future of doctoral studies."--Publisher's website.  0aHumanitiesxData processing. 0aHumanitiesxResearchxData processing. 0aDigital humanitiesxResearch. 0aCommunication in learning and scholarshipxTechnological innovations.1 aKuhn, Virginia,d1961-eeditor.1 aFinger, Anke K.,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0239zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0239.jpgzConnect to cover image05331nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000340030624501310034026400470047126400110051830000620052933600260059133700260061733800360064350000440067950600480072353800360077154001650080750400530097250519550102552014260298065000550440665000480446165000490450965000510455865000770460971000380468685600570472485600920478199100186490970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         210528t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800640900 (hbk.)  z9781800640894 (pbk.)  a9781800640917q(pdf)  a9781800640924q(epub)  a9781800640931q(mobi)  a9781800640948q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1256259473  aStSaULbengerda1 aLövei, Gábor L.,eauthor.10aWriting and publishing scientific papersh[electronic resource] :ba primer for the non-English speaker /cGábor L.

Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers is the distillation of Lövei's lecture notes and experience gathered over two decades; it is the coursebook many have been waiting for.  The book's three main sections correspond with the three main stages of a paper's journey from idea to print: planning, writing, and publishing. Within the book's chapters, complex questions such as 'How to write the introduction?' or 'How to submit a manuscript?' are broken down into smaller, more manageable problems that are then discussed in a straightforward, conversational manner, providing an easy and enjoyable reading experience.  Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers stands out from its field by targeting scientists whose first language is not English. While also touching on matters of style and grammar, the book's main goal is to advise on first principles of communication.  This book is an excellent resource for any student or scientist wishing to learn more about the scientific publishing process and scientific communication. It will be especially useful to those coming from outside the English-speaking world and looking for a comprehensive guide for publishing their work in English."--Publisher's website.  0aCommunication in sciencevHandbooks, manuals, etc. 0aTechnical writingvHandbooks, manuals, etc. 0aScience publishingvHandbooks, manuals, etc. 0aScholarly publishingvHandbooks, manuals, etc. 0aEnglish languagexComposition and exercisesxStudy and teaching (Higher)2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0235zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0235.jpgzConnect to cover image04791nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000260023803500220026404000210028610000410030724501260034826400470047426400110052130000620053233600260059433700260062033800360064650000440068250600480072653800360077454001650081050400530097550511690102852017650219765000600396265000600402265000380408265000380412071000380415885600570419685600920425399100186495970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         210528t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783747702 (hbk.)  z9781783747696 (pbk.)  a9781783747719q(pdf)  a9781783747726q(epub)  a9781783747733q(mobi)  a978178374774-0q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1255690748  aStSaULbengerda1 aNisbet, H.

A recognised authority in the field, Nisbet grapples with the major voices of the Enlightenment and gives pride of place to the figures of Lessing, Herder, Goethe and Schiller.  These eleven essays range widely in their compass of thought and intellectual discourse, dealing incisively with themes including the philosophical implications of literature and the relationship between religion, science and politics. The result is an accomplished reflection on German thought, but also on its rebirth, as Nisbet argues for the relevance of these Enlightenment thinkers for the readers of today. The first half of this collection focuses predominantly on eighteenth-century thought, where names like Lessing, Goethe and Herder, but also Locke and Voltaire, feature. The second has a wider chronological scope, discussing authors such as Winckelmann and Schiller, while branching out from discussions of religion, philosophy and literature to explore the sciences. Issues of biology, early environmentalism, and natural history also form part of this volume. The collection concludes with an examination of changing attitudes towards art in the aftermath of the 'Age of Goethe.' The essays in this volume have been previously published separately, but are brought together in this collection to present Nisbet's widely-acclaimed perspectives on this fascinating period of German thought. It will be of interest to scholars and students of the intellectual life of Europe during the Enlightenment, while its engaging and lucid style will also appeal to the general reader."--Publisher's website.  0aGerman literaturey18th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aGerman literaturey19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aPhilosophy, Germany18th century. 0aPhilosophy, Germany19th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0180zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0180.jpgzConnect to cover image02675nam a2200361 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013603500220016104000210018310000290020424500650023326400470029826400110034530000590035633600260041533700260044133800360046750000440050350600480054753800360059554001650063150400530079650503240084952009300117365000230210371000380212685600570216485600920222199100186685970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         210601t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800641761 (pbk.)  a9781800641778q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1259295880  aStSaULbengerda1 aRossi, Roberto,eauthor.10aInventory analyticsh[electronic resource] /cRoberto Rossi. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (184 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

We are immersed in a world mediated by information and communication technologies (ICTs). From hardware like smartphones, smartwatches, and home assistants to software like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat, our lives have become a complex, interconnected network of relations. Scholarship on media literacy has tended to focus on developing the skills to access, analyze, evaluate, and create media messages without considering or weighing the impact of the technological medium-how it enables and constrains both messages and media users. Additionally, there is often little attention paid to the broader context of interrelations which affect our engagement with media technologies. This book addresses these issues by providing a transdisciplinary method that allows for both practical and theoretical analyses of media investigations. Informed by postphenomenology, media ecology, philosophical posthumanism, and complexity theory the author proposes both a framework and a pragmatic instrument for understanding the multiplicity of relations that all contribute to how we affect-and are affected by-our relations with media technology. The author argues persuasively that the increased awareness provided by this posthuman approach affords us a greater chance for reclaiming some of our agency and provides a sound foundation upon which we can then judge our media relations. This book will be an indispensable tool for educators in media literacy and media studies, as well as academics in philosophy of technology, media and communication studies, and the post-humanities."--Publisher's website.  0aMass mediaxSocial aspects. 0aMass mediaxTechnological innovationsxSocial aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0253zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0253.jpgzConnect to cover image04442nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028524501350030626400470044126400110048830000620049933600260056133700260058733800360061350000440064950600480069353800360074154001650077750400530094250511090099552016200210465000470372470000320377170000300380371000380383385600570387185600920392899100188670970896620250313114129.0m        d        cr  n         210625t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800641204 (hbk.)  z9781800641198 (pbk.)  a9781800641211q(pdf)  a9781800641228q(epub)  a9781800641235q(mobi)  a9781800641242q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1257479703  aStSaULbengerda00aReading backwardsh[electronic resource] :ban advance retrospective on Russian literature /cMuireann Maguire and Timothy Langen. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (302 pages) :b11 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Reversing established critical approaches to the canon and literary influence, its contributors ask us to consider how reading against linear chronologies can elicit fascinating new patterns and perspectives. Reading Backwards: An Advance Retrospective on Russian Literature re-assesses three major nineteenth-century authors-Gogol, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy-either in terms of previous writers and artists who plagiarized them (such as Raphael, Homer, or Hall Caine), or of their own depredations against later writers (from J.M. Coetzee to Liudmila Petrushevskaia). Far from suggesting that past authors literally stole from their descendants, these engaging essays, contributed by both early-career and senior scholars of Russian and comparative literature, encourage us to identify the contingent and familiar within classic texts. By moving beyond rigid notions of cultural heritage and literary canons, they demonstrate that inspiration is cyclical, influence can flow in multiple directions, and no idea is ever truly original. This book will be of great value to literary scholars and students working in Russian Studies. The introductory discussion of the origins and context of 'plagiarism by anticipation', alongside varied applications of the concept, will also be of interest to those working in the wider fields of comparative literature, reception studies, and translation studies."--Publisher's website.  0aRussian literaturexHistory and criticism.1 aMaguire, Muireann,eeditor.1 aLangen, Timothy,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0241zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0241.jpgzConnect to cover image04603nam a2200553 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031404100130033510000460034824000330039424501680042726400460059526400110064130000610065233600260071333700260073933800360076549000510080150000600085250000440091250600480095653800360100454001650104050400410120550504780124652017050172454600320342960000510346160000640351260000890357665000410366570000690370670000440377571000380381983000430385785600570390085600920395799100190388970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         170217t20172017enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783742646 (Hardback)  z9781783742639 (Paperback)  a9781783742653q(pdf)  a9781783742660q(epub)  a9781783742677q(mobi)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)976024441   aStSaULbengerda1 aenghger1 aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805,eauthor.10aWallenstein.lEnglish.f201710aWallensteinh[electronic resource] :ba dramatic poem /cby Friedrich Schiller ; translation and notes to the text by Flora Kimmich ; introduction by Roger Paulin. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (322 pages) :b5 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen Book classics seriesx2054-2178 ;vv. 5    aEdition statement information from publisher's website.  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Consisting of Wallenstein's Camp, The Piccolomini and Wallenstein's Death, this suite of plays appeared between 1798 and 1799, each production under the original direction of Schiller's collaborator and mentor, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Across the three plays, which are now commonly performed and printed together, Schiller charts the thwarted rebellion of General Albrecht von Wallenstein. Based loosely on the events of the Thirty Years' War, the trilogy provides a unique perspective on an army's loyalty to their commander and the machinations and intrigues of international diplomacy, giving insight into the military hero who is placed on the threshold between these forces as they are increasingly pitted against one another. The Wallenstein trilogy, formally innovative and modern beyond its time, is a brilliant study of power, ambition and betrayal. In this new translation-the latest in a long line of distinguished English translations starting with Coleridge's in Schiller's lifetime-Flora Kimmich succeeds in rendering what is often a difficult source text into language that is at once accessible and enjoyable. Coupled with a complete and careful commentary and a glossary, both of which are targeted to undergraduates, it is accompanied by an authoritative introductory essay by Roger Paulin. Kimmich's translation will be an invaluable resource for students of German, European literature and history, and military history, as well as to all readers approaching this important set of plays for the first time."--Publisher's website.  aTranslated from the German.10aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805.tWallenstein.10aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805vTranslations into English.10aWallenstein, Albrecht Wenzel Eusebius von,cHerzog von Friedland,d1583-1634vDrama. 0aThirty Years' War, 1618-1648vDrama.1 aKimmich, Flora,d1939-etranslator,ewriter of added commentary.1 aPaulin, Roger,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen Book classics ;vv. 5.x2054-217840uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0101zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0101.jpgzConnect to cover image04727nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026804100130028910000310030224500840033326400460041726400110046330000620047433600260053633700260056233800360058850000600062450000440068450600480072853800360077654002110081250400510102350510470107452018820212165000430400365000240404665000240407071000380409485600570413285600920418999100192499970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         170223t20172017enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783742493 (Hardback)  z9781783742486 (Paperback)  a9781783742509q(pdf)  a9781783742516q(epub)  a9781783742523q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)976022883  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghger1 aBateson, Patrick,eauthor.10aBehaviour, development and evolutionh[electronic resource] /cPatrick Bateson. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2017. 4c©2017  a1 online resource (134 pages) :b22 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aEdition statement information from publisher's website.  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Like so many fundamental questions about human existence, these issues all relate to behavioural development. In this lucid and accessible book, eminent biologist Professor Sir Patrick Bateson suggests that the nature/nurture dichotomy we often use to think about questions of development in both humans and animals is misleading. Instead, he argues that we should pay attention to whole systems, rather than to simple causes, when trying to understand the complexity of development. In his wide-ranging approach Bateson discusses why so much behaviour appears to be well-designed. He explores issues such as 'imprinting' and its importance to the attachment of offspring to their parents; the mutual benefits that characterise communication between parent and offspring; the importance of play in learning how to choose and control the optimal conditions in which to thrive; and the vital function of adaptability in the interplay between development and evolution. Bateson disputes the idea that a simple link can be found between genetics and behaviour. What an individual human or animal does in its life depends on the reciprocal nature of its relationships with the world about it. This knowledge also points to ways in which an animal's own behaviour can provide the variation that influences the subsequent course of evolution. This has relevance not only for our scientific approaches to the systems of development and evolution, but also on how humans change institutional rules that have become dysfunctional, or design public health measures when mismatches occur between themselves and their environments. It affects how we think about ourselves and our own capacity for change."--Publisher's website. 0aHuman behaviorxPsychological aspects. 0aBehavior evolution. 0aNature and nurture.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0097zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0097.jpgzConnect to cover image03896nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028510000290030624501040033526400470043926400110048630000350049733600260053233700260055833800360058450000440062050600480066453800360071254001650074850400530091350508550096652013450182165000120316665000350317865000280321365000220324171000380326385600570330185600920335899100198586970896620250313114128.0m        d        cr  n         210720t20212021enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800642317 (hbk.)  z9781800642300 (pbk.)  a9781800642324q(pdf)  a9781800642331q(epub)  a9781800642348q(mobi)  a9781800642355q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1260292451  aStSaULbengerda1 aHens, Kristien,eauthor.10aTowards an ethics of autismh[electronic resource] :ba philosophical exploration /cKristien Hens. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2021] 4c©2021  a1 online resource (206 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Towards an Ethics of Autism is an exploration of this question and many more. In this thoughtful, wide-ranging book, Kristien Hens examines a number of perspectives on autism, including psychiatric, biological, and philosophical, to consider different ways of thinking about autism, as well as its meanings to those who experience it, those who diagnose it, and those who research it.  Hens delves into the history of autism and its roots in the work of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger to inform a contemporary ethical analysis of the models we use to understand autism today. She explores the various impacts of a diagnosis on autistic people and their families, the relevance of disability studies, the need to include autistic people fully in discussions about (and research on) autism, and the significance of epigenetics to future work on autism. Hens weaves together a variety of perspectives that guide the reader in their own ethical reflections about autism. Rich, accessible, and multi-layered, this is essential reading for philosophers, educational scientists, and psychologists who are interested in philosophical-ethical questions related to autism, but it also has much to offer to teachers, allied health professionals, and autistic people themselves."--Publisher's website.  0aAutism. 0aAutismxPsychological aspects. 0aAutismxSocial aspects. 0aAutismxResearch.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0261zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0261.jpgzConnect to cover image04691nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016103500220018604000210020810000330022924501010026225000180036326400470038126400110042830000350043933600260047433700260050033800360052650000440056250600480060653800360065454001830069050001650087350001800103850400530121850513340127152013960260565000200400165000170402170000320403871000380407085600570410885600920416599101318879970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         200407t20202020enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783749218 (hbk.)  z9781783749201 (pbk.)  a9781783749225q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1155128079  aStSaULbengerda1 aOsborne, Martin J.,eauthor.00aModels in microeconomic theoryh[electronic resource] /cMartin J.

Part I (Chapters 1-7) presents models of an economic agent, discussing abstract models of preferences, choice, and decision making under uncertainty, before turning to models of the consumer, the producer, and monopoly. Part II (Chapters 8-14) introduces the concept of equilibrium, beginning, unconventionally, with the models of the jungle and an economy with indivisible goods, and continuing with models of an exchange economy, equilibrium with rational expectations, and an economy with asymmetric information. Part III (Chapters 15-16) provides an introduction to game theory, covering strategic and extensive games and the concepts of Nash equilibrium and subgame perfect equilibrium. Part IV (Chapters 17-20) gives a taste of the topics of mechanism design, matching, the axiomatic analysis of economic systems, and social choice. The book focuses on the concepts of model and equilibrium. It states models and results precisely, and provides proofs for all results. It uses only elementary mathematics (with almost no calculus), although many of the proofs involve sustained logical arguments. It includes about 150 exercises. With its formal but accessible style, this textbook is designed for undergraduate students of microeconomics at intermediate and advanced levels."."--Publisher's website. 0aMicroeconomics. 0aGame theory.1 aRubinstein, Ariel,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0204zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0204.jpgzConnect to cover image03688nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000410031524501330035624600140048926400460050326400110054930000590056033600260061933700260064533800360067150000440070750600480075153800360079954001770083550400660101250504740107852014480155260000320300070000350303271000380306785600570310585600920316299101322744970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         200430t20202020enka    sb    000 0beng d  z9781783748709 (Hardback)  z9781783748693 (Paperback)  a9781783748716q(pdf)  a9781783748723q(epub)  a9781783748730q(mobi)  a9781783748747q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1155116328  aStSaULbengerda1 aSharp, William,d1855-1905,eauthor.14aThe life and letters of William Sharp and "Fiona Macleod".nVolume II,p1895-1899h[electronic resource] /cWilliam F.

Sharp was a Scottish poet, novelist, biographer and editor who in 1893 began to write critically and commercially successful books under the name Fiona Macleod. This was far more than just a pseudonym: he corresponded as Macleod, enlisting his sister to provide the handwriting and address, and for more than a decade "Fiona Macleod" duped not only the general public but such literary luminaries as William Butler Yeats and, in America, E. C. Stedman. Sharp wrote "I feel another self within me now more than ever; it is as if I were possessed by a spirit who must speak out". This three-volume collection brings together Sharp's own correspondence - a fascinating trove in its own right, by a Victorian man of letters who was on intimate terms with writers including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Walter Pater, and George Meredith - and the Fiona Macleod letters, which bring to life Sharp's intriguing "second self". With an introduction and detailed notes by William F. Halloran, this richly rewarding collection offers a wonderful insight into the literary landscape of the time, while also investigating a strange and underappreciated phenomenon of late-nineteenth-century English literature. It is essential for scholars of the period, and it is an illuminating read for anyone interested in authorship and identity."--Publisher's website.10aSharp, William,d1855-1905.1 aHalloran, William F.,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0196zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0196.jpgzConnect to cover image04812nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501170031524600240043226400460045626400110050230000620051333600260057533700260060133800360062750000440066350600480070753800360075554001770079150000800096850002310104850400510127950512200133052013150255065000190386565000130388465000430389765000470394070000450398770000520403270000350408471000380411985600570415785600920421499101322789970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         200430t20202020enka    sb    001 0deng d  z9781783748464 (Hardback)  z9781783748457 (Paperback)  a9781783748471q(pdf)  a9781783748488q(epub)  a9781783748495q(mobi)  a9781783748501q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1153079152  aStSaULbengerda00aEarth 2020h[electronic resource] :ban insider's guide to a rapidly changing planet /cPhillipe Tortell, (ed.).3 aEarth twenty twenty 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (274 pages) :b15 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This accessible, incisive and timely collection of essays brings together a diverse set of expert voices to examine how the Earth's environment has changed over this past half century, and what lies in store for our planet over the coming fifty years. Earth 2020: An Insider's Guide to a Rapidly Changing Planet responds to a public increasingly concerned about the deterioration of Earth's natural systems, offering readers a wealth of perspectives on our shared ecological past, and on the future trajectory of planet Earth.  Written by world-leading thinkers on the front-lines of global change research and policy, this multi-disciplinary collection maintains a dual focus: some essays investigate specific facets of the physical Earth system, while others explore the social, legal and political dimensions shaping the human environmental footprint. In doing so, the essays collectively highlight the urgent need for collaboration across diverse domains of expertise in addressing one of the most significant challenges facing us today. Earth 2020 is essential reading for everyone seeking a deeper understanding of the past, present and future of our planet, and the role of humanity in shaping this trajectory."--Publisher's website. 0aHuman ecology. 0aEcology. 0aEarth (Planet)xEnvironmental aspects. 0aEarth (Planet)xEffect of human beings on.1 aTortell, Philippec(Professor),eeditor.12aTortell, Phillipec(Professor).tIce core walk.12aChafe, Chris.tEarth symphony.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0193zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0193.jpgzConnect to cover image04210nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000280031524501240034326400460046726400110051330000850052433600260060933700260063533800360066150000440069750600480074153800360078954001770082550400530100250505410105552017170159660000340331365000670334765000690341465000460348365000360352971000380356585600570360385600920366099101323170970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         200505t20202020enkaj   sb    001 0beng d  z9781783748822 (Hardback)  z9781783748815 (Paperback)  a9781783748839q(pdf)  a9781783748846q(epub)  a9781783748853q(mobi)  a9781783748860q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1235837800  aStSaULbengerda1 aPollard, Lucy,eauthor.10aMargery Spring Riceh[electronic resource] :bpioneer of women's health in the early twentieth century /cLucy Pollard. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (222 pages) :b27 colour illustrations, 4 genealogical tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text of this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Margery Spring Rice, née Garrett, was born into a family of formidable female trailblazers - niece of physician and suffragist Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, and of Millicent Fawcett, a leading suffragist and campaigner for equal rights for women. Margery Spring Rice continued this legacy with her co-founding of the North Kensington birth control clinic in 1924, three years after Marie Stopes founded the first clinic in Britain. Engaging and accessible, this biography weaves together Spring Rice's personal and professional lives, adopting a chronological approach which highlights how the one impacted the other. Her life unfolds against the turbulent backdrop of the early twentieth century - a period which sees the entry of women into higher education, and the upheaval and societal upshots of two world wars. Within this context, Spring Rice emerges as a dynamic figure who dedicated her life to social causes, and whose actions time and again bear out her habitual belief that, contrary to the Shakespearian dictum, 'valour is the better part of discretion'. This is the first biography of Margery Spring Rice, drawing extensively on letters, diaries and other archival material, and equipping the text with family trees and photographs. It will be of great interest to a range of social historians, especially those researching the birth control movement; female friendships, female philanthropists, and feminist activism in the twentieth century; and the history of medicine and public health."--Publisher's website.10aSpring Rice, Margery Garrett. 0aWomen's health serviceszGreat BritainxHistoryy20th century. 0aWomenxHealth and hygienezGreat BritainxHistoryy20th century. 0aWomenxSocial conditionsxHealth aspects. 0aFamily planningzGreat Britain.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0215zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0215.jpgzConnect to cover image06010nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501480031526400460046326400110050930000610052033600260058133700260060733800360063350000440066950600480071353800360076154002410079750000200103850521460105852019730320465000130517765000190519065000340520965000180524370000330526170000340529470000250532871000380535385600570539185600920544899101325178970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         200518t20202020enka    s     001 0 eng d  z9781783748044 (Hardback)  z9781783748037 (Paperback)  a9781783748051q(pdf)  a9781783748068q(epub)  a9781783748075q(mobi)  a9781783748082q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1156058313  aStSaULbengerda00aLiving earth communityh[electronic resource] :bmultiple ways of being and knowing /cedited by Sam Mickey, Mary Evelyn Tucker, and John Grim. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (286 pages) :b9 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work as a whole is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs license (CCBY-NC-ND).

Innovative, informative, and highly accessible, this interdisciplinary anthology of essays brings together scholars, writers and educators across the sciences and humanities, in a collaborative effort to illuminate the different ways of being in the world and the different kinds of knowledge they entail - from the ecological knowledge of indigenous communities, to the scientific knowledge of a biologist and the embodied knowledge communicated through storytelling. This anthology examines the interplay between Nature and Culture in the setting of our current age of ecological crisis, stressing the importance of addressing these ecological crises occurring around the planet through multiple perspectives. These perspectives are exemplified through diverse case studies, from a study on the significance of the birdsong of the huia (an extinct species of New Zealand wattlebird) for the Māori people, and its commodification and extinction in the aftermath of colonialism; to a study on the promotion of ecological learning through network thinking, as evinced in a range of examples that portray the basic patterns of networks - the neurological network of a brain, the mycelial network of a fungus, the Internet, and the transportation system of global society. Living Earth Community: Multiple Ways of Being and Knowing synthesizes insights from across a range of academic fields, and highlights the potential for synergy between disciplinary approaches and inquiries. This anthology is essential reading not only for researchers and students, but for anyone interested in the ways in which humans interact with the community of life on Earth, especially during this current period of environmental emergency."--Publisher's website. 0aEcology. 0aHuman ecology.0 aHuman ecologyvCase studies.  0aBiodiversity.1 aMickey, Sam,d1981-eeditor.1 aTucker, Mary Evelyn,eeditor.1 aGrim, John,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0186zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0186.jpgzConnect to cover image04302nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023802200240026302200230028703500220031004000210033204100130035324500820036626401190044826400110056730000350057833600260061333700260063933800360066549000660070150000440076750600480081153800360085954001650089550000700106050400510113050509360118154602200211754600330233752009830237063000300335365000310338370000290341471000870344371000380353083000550356885600570362385600920368099101327635970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         200528t20202020enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783746811 (hbk.)  z9781783746804 (pbk.)  a9781783746828q(pdf)  a9781783746835q(epub)  a9781783746842q(azw3)  a9781783747689q(XML)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1229820635  aStSaULbengerda0 aenghheb00aStudies in Rabbinic Hebrewh[electronic resource] /cedited by Shai Heijmans. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers ;aUniversity of Cambridge, Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies,c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (240 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 2  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Despite the fact that Rabbinic Hebrew has been the subject of growing academic interest across the past century, very little scholarship has been written on it in English. Studies in Rabbinic Hebrew addresses this lacuna, with eight lucid but technically rigorous articles written in English by a range of experienced scholars, focusing on various aspects of Rabbinic Hebrew: its phonology, morphology, syntax, pragmatics and lexicon. This volume is essential reading for students and scholars of Rabbinic studies alike, and constitutes the second in a new series, Studies in Semitic Languages and Cultures, in collaboration with the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Cambridge."--Publisher's website. 00aMishnahxLanguage, style. 0aHebrew language, Talmudic.1 aHeijmans, Shai,eeditor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies,epublisher.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 2.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0164zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0164.jpgzConnect to cover image05477nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202000250023803500220026304000210028524501940030626400470050026400110054730000620055833600260062033700260064633800360067250000440070850600480075253800360080054001650083650400530100150513540105452018700240865000210427865000480429965000220434770000530436970000460442270000380446870000460450670000450455270000400459770000480463771000870468571000380477285600570481085600920486799101328828970896620250313114124.0m        d        cr  n         200602t20202020enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783749300 (hbk.)  z9781783749294 (pbk.)  a9781783749317q(pdf)  a9781783749324q(epub)  a9781783749331q(azw3)  a9781783749348q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1155202220  aStSaULbengerda00aCreative multilingualismh[electronic resource] :ba manifesto /cedited by Katrin Kohl, Rajinder Dudrah, Andrew Gosler, Suzanne Graham, Martin Maiden, Wen-chin Ouyang and Matthew Reynolds. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (334 pages) :b3 colour illustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Hinging on the concept of Creative Multilingualism - the idea that language diversity and creativity are mutually enriching - this timely and thought-provoking volume shows how the concept provides a matrix for experimentation with ideas, approaches and methods. The book presents four years of joint research on Creative Multilingualism conducted across disciplines, from the humanities through to the social and natural sciences. It is structured as a manifesto, comprising ten major statements which are unpacked and explored through various case studies across ten chapters. They encompass areas including the rich relationship between language diversity and diversity of identity, thought and expression; the interaction between language diversity and biodiversity; the 'prismatic' unfolding of meaning in translation; the benefits of linguistic creativity in a classroom-setting; and the ingenuity underpinning 'conlangs' ('constructed languages') such as Tolkien's Quenya and Sindarin, designed to give imagined peoples a distinctive medium capable of expressing their cultural identity. Creative Multilingualism: A Manifesto is a welcome contribution to the field of modern languages, highlighting the intricate relationship between multilingualism and creativity, and, crucially, reaching beyond an Anglo-centric view of the world. Intended to spark further research and discussion, this book appeals to young people interested in languages, language learning and cultural exchange. It will be a valuable resource for academics, educators, policy makers and parents of bilingual or multilingual children. Its accessible style also speaks to general readers interested in the role of language diversity in our everyday lives, and the untapped creative potential of multilingualism."--Publisher's website. 0aMultilingualism. 0aLanguage and languagesxStudy and teaching. 0aSociolinguistics.1 aKohl, Katrin M.q(Katrin Maria),d1956-eeditor.1 aDudrah, Rajinder Kumar,eeditor,eauthor.1 aGosler, Andrew,eeditor,eauthor.1 aGraham, Suzanne,d1963-eeditor,eauthor.1 aMaiden, Martin,d1957-eeditor,eauthor.1 aOuyang, Wen-chin,eeditor,eauthor.1 aReynolds, Matthew,d1969-eeditor,eauthor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies,epublisher.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0206zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0206.jpgzConnect to cover image04175nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025524501320027626400470040826400110045530000660046633600260053233700260055833800360058449000660062050000440068650600480073053800360077854001650081450000700097950400410104950512850109052009240237565000380329965000340333765000300337170000330340170000290343471000380346383000550350185600570355685600920361399101330106970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         200605t20202020enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783749362 (hbk.)  z9781783749355 (pbk.)  a9781783749379q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1156322478  aStSaULbengerda00aStudies in Semitic vocalisation and reading traditionsh[electronic resource] /cedited by Aaron D.

The papers focus on sources representative of a period that stretches from late antiquity until the Middle Ages. A large proportion of them concern reading traditions of Biblical Hebrew, especially the vocalisation notation systems used to represent them. Also discussed are orthography and the written representation of prosody. Beyond Biblical Hebrew, there are studies concerning Punic, Biblical Aramaic, Syriac, and Arabic, as well as post-biblical traditions of Hebrew such as piyyuṭ and medieval Hebrew poetry. There were many parallels and interactions between these various language traditions and the volume demonstrates that important insights can be gained from such a wide range of perspectives across different historical periods."--Publisher's website.  0aSemitic languagesxPronunciation. 0aSemitic languagesxPhonetics. 0aSemitic languagesvTexts.1 aHornkohl, Aaron D.,eeditor.1 aKhan, Geoffrey,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 3.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0207zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0207.jpgzConnect to cover image04972nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024702200230027202200230029503500230031804000210034124501200036226400460048226400110052830000590053933600260059833700260062433800360065049000430068650000440072950600480077353800360082154001650085750514430102252015090246565000500397465000510402465000510407565000530412670000340417970000340421371000380424783000440428585600570432985600920438699101331633970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         200615t20202020enka    sb    000 0deng d  z9781800640122 (Hardback)  z9781800640115 (Paperback)  a9781800640139q(pdf)  a9781800640146q(epub)  a9781800640153q(mobi)  a9781800640160q(XML)  z2399-6668 (Print)   a2399-6676 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1159173753   aStSaULbengerda02aA European public investment outlookh[electronic resource] /cedited by Floriana Cerniglia and Francesco Saraceno. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (xxii, 198 pages) :billustrations.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen reports seriesx2399-6676vvol. 9  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

A European Public Investment Outlook brings together contributions from a range of international authors from diverse intellectual and professional backgrounds, providing a valuable resource for the policy-making community in Europe to feed their discussion on public investment. The volume both offers sector-specific advice and highlights larger areas which should be prioritized in the policy debate (from transport to social capital, R&D and the environment). The Outlook is structured into two parts: the chapters of Part I respectively explore public investment trends in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Europe as a whole, and illuminate how the legacy of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis is one of insufficient public investment. Part II investigates some areas into which resources could be channelled to reverse the recent trend and provide European economies with an adequate public capital stock. The essays in this outlook collectively foster a broad approach to and definition of public investment, that is today more relevant than ever. Offering up a timely and clear case for the elimination of bias against investment in European fiscal rules, this outlook is a welcome contribution to the European debate, aimed both at policy makers and general readers."--Publisher's website. 0aCOVID-19 (Disease)xEconomic aspectszEurope. 0aGlobal Financial Crisis, 2008-2009xInfluence. 0aPublic investmentsxGovernment policyzEurope. 0aEconomic developmentxGovernment policyzEurope.1 aCerniglia, Floriana,eeditor.1 aSaraceno, Francesco,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen reports series ;vv. 9.x2399-667640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0222zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0222.jpgzConnect to cover image06121nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029404300120031524501510032726400460047826400110052430000340053533600260056933700260059533800360062150000440065750600480070153800360074954001650078550000980095050511710104852028310221965000360505065000410508665000380512765000420516565100510520770000330525870000360529170000300532770000300535770000290538771000380541685600570545485600920551199101333698970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         200622t20202020enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783748167 (Hardback)  z9781783748150 (Paperback)  a9781783748174q(pdf)  a9781783748181q(epub)  a9781783748198q(mobi)  a9781783748204q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1203548337  aStSaULbengerda  aev-----02aA lexicon of medieval Nordic lawh[electronic resource] /cedited by Jeffrey Love, Inger Larsson, Ulrike Djarv, Christine Peel, and Erik Simensen. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (586 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This polyglot dictionary draws on the vast and vibrant range of vernacular legal terminology found in medieval Scandinavian texts - terminology which yields valuable insights into the quotidian realities of crime and retribution; the processes, application and execution of laws; and the cultural and societal concerns underlying the development and promulgation of such laws. Legal texts constitute an unparalleled - and often untapped - source of information for those studying the literature, languages and history of medieval and Viking Age Scandinavia. The Lexicon is a welcome contribution to the study of medieval Scandinavia on two counts: firstly, it makes accessible a wealth of vernacular historical documents for an English-speaking audience. Secondly, it presents legal terminologies that span the languages and geographies of medieval Scandinavia, drawing on twenty-five legal texts composed in Old Swedish, Old Icelandic, Old Norwegian, Old Danish, Old Gutnish and Old Faroese. By collating and juxtaposing legal terms, the Lexicon thus offers its readers a fascinating, comprehensive window into the legal milieu of medieval Scandinavia as a unified whole. It is in this respect that A Lexicon of Medieval Nordic Law differs from the other major lexica that came before it: where relevant, it gathers closely related terms from multiple Nordic languages beneath single headwords within single entries. This approach illuminates the differences (and similarities) in usage of specific lexical items and legal concepts across geographic areas and through time. This dictionary contains over 6000 Nordic headwords, and is laid out as a standard reference work. It is easily navigable, with a clear structure to each entry, providing English equivalents; textual references; phrases in which headwords frequently appear; cross-references to aid readers in locating synonyms or cognate terms within the lexicon; and references to published works. Roughly one quarter of the headwords supply semantic analysis and detailed information on the textual and historical contexts within which a term might appear, which help the reader to engage with the broader legal concepts underlying specific terms. The Lexicon is thus designed to provide its readers not only with succinct single definitions of Norse legal terms, but with a sense of the wider Scandinavian legal landscape and worldview within which these concepts were developed. A Lexicon of Medieval Nordic Law is an ongoing project with a digital counterpart created within the department of Swedish Language and Multilingualism at Stockholm University. It is part of the wider 'Medieval Nordic Laws' project based at the University of Aberdeen."--Publisher's website. 0aLawzScandinaviaxDictionaries. 0aLawzScandinaviaxTerms and phrases. 0aOld Norse languagevDictionaries. 0aScandinavian languagesvDictionaries. 0aScandinaviaxSocial life and customsxHistory.1 aLove, Jeffrey Alan,eeditor.1 aLarsson, Inger,d1945-eeditor.1 aDjärv, Ulrika,eeditor.1 aPeel, Christine,eeditor.1 aSimensen, Erik,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0188zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0188.jpgzConnect to cover image07465nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000270022102000250024803500220027304000210029524501490031626400460046526400110051130000520052233600260057433700260060033800360062650000440066250600480070653800360075454001650079050538920095552017220484765000350656965000490660465000580665365000190671165000210673070000310675170000380678271000380682085600570685885600920691599101348311970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         200710t20202020enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783748525 (Hardback)  z9781783748518 (Paperback)  a9781783748532q(pdf)  a9781783748549q(epub)  a9781783748556 q(mobi)  a9781783748563q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1225892701  aStSaULbengerda00aDiscourses we live byh[electronic resource] :bnarratives of educational and social endeavour /cedited by Hazel R.

What are the embedded values and practices that underpin the ways people think and act? Discourses We Live By approaches these questions through narrative research, in a process that uses words, images, activities or artefacts to ask people - either individually or collectively within social groupings - to examine, discuss, portray or otherwise make public their place in the world, their sense of belonging to (and identity within) the physical and cultural space they inhabit. This book is a rich and multifaceted collection of twenty-eight chapters that use varied lenses to examine the discourses that shape people's lives. The contributors are themselves from many backgrounds - different academic disciplines within the humanities and social sciences, diverse professional practices and a range of countries and cultures. They represent a broad spectrum of age, status and outlook, and variously apply their research methods - but share a common interest in people, their lives, thoughts and actions. Gathering such eclectic experiences as those of student-teachers in Kenya, a released prisoner in Denmark, academics in Colombia, a group of migrants learning English, and gambling addiction support-workers in Italy, alongside more mainstream educational themes, the book presents a fascinating array of insights. Discourses We Live By will be essential reading for adult educators and practitioners, those involved with educational and professional practice, narrative researchers, and many sociologists. It will appeal to all who want to know how narratives shape the way we live and the way we talk about our lives."--Publisher's website. 0aDiscourse analysis, Narrative. 0aDiscourse analysis, NarrativevCase studies. 0aDiscourse analysis, NarrativexResearchxMethodology. 0aAutobiography. 0aSelf-perception.1 aWright, Hazel R.,eeditor.1 aHøyen, Marianne,d1959-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0203zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0203.jpgzConnect to cover image04148nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029424501900031526400460050526400110055130000620056233600260062433600330065033700260068333800360070950000440074550600480078953800360083754001650087350400390103850507200107752014030179765000360320065000370323665000510327365100310332465100450335570000380340070000410343871000380347985600570351785600920357499101349405970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         200728t20202020enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783746941 (Hardback)  z9781783746934 (Paperback)  a9781783746958q(pdf)  a9781783746965q(epub)  a9781783746972q(mobi)  a9781783746989q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1183399883  aStSaULbengerda00aSailing from polis to empireh[electronic resource] :bships in the eastern Mediterranean during the Hellenistic Period /cedited by Emmanuel Nantet ; [with a preface by Alain Bresson]. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2020. 4c©2020  a1 online resource (148 pages) :b48 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

How do such insights inform our knowledge of the ancient economies that depended on maritime trade across the Mediterranean? These and similar questions lie behind Sailing from Polis to Empire, a fascinating insight into the practicalities of trading by boat in the ancient world. Allying modern scientific knowledge with Hellenistic sources, this interdisciplinary collection brings together experts in various fields of ship archaeology to shed new light on the role played by ships and sailing in the exchange networks of the Mediterranean. Covering all parts of the Eastern Mediterranean, these outstanding contributions delve into a broad array of data - literary, epigraphical, papyrological, iconographic and archaeological - to understand the trade routes that connected the economies of individual cities and kingdoms. Unique in its interdisciplinary approach and focus on the Hellenistic period, this collection digs into the questions that others don't think to ask, and comes up with (sometimes surprising) answers. It will be of value to researchers in the fields of naval architecture, Classical and Hellenistic history, social history and ancient geography, and to all those with an interest in the ancient world or the seafaring life."--Publisher's website. 0aShip-buildingzGreecexHistory. 0aTransportationzGreecexHistory. 0aTransportationzMediterranean RegionxHistory. 0aGreecexCommercexHistory. 0aMediterranean RegionxCommercexHistory.1 aNantet, Emmanuel,d1982-eeditor.1 aBresson, Alain,ewriter of foreword.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0167zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0167.jpgzConnect to cover image06433nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019503500220022104000210024324501480026426400470041226400110045930000620047033600260053233700260055833800360058450000440062050600480066453800360071254001660074850400530091450530790096752014730404665000100551965000390552965000260556865000470559465000530564165000250569470000310571970000380575071000380578885600570582685600920588399101350135970896620250313114122.0m     o  d        cr  n         230605t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648920 (hardback)  z9781800648913 (paperback)  a9781800648937q(pdf)  a9781800648975q(HTML)  a(OCoLC)1385454677  aStSaULbengerda00aPlay in a covid frameh[electronic resource] :beveryday pandemic creativity in a time of isolation /cedited by Anna Beresin and Julia Bishop. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xxxii, 490 pages) :b81 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

How did the pandemic restrict everyday play and how did the pandemic offer new spaces and new content? This unique collection of essays documents the ways in which communities around the world harnessed play within the limiting frame of Covid-19. Folklorists Anna Beresin and Julia Bishop adopt a multidisciplinary approach to this phenomenon, bringing together the insights of a geographically and demographically diverse range of scholars, practitioners, and community activists. The book begins with a focus on social and physical landscapes before moving onto more intimate portraits of play among the old and young, including coronavirus-themed games and novel toy inventions. Finally, the co-authors explore the creative shifts observed in frames of play, ranging from Zoom screens to street walls. This singular chronicle of coronavirus play will be of interest to researchers and students of developmental psychology, childhood studies, education, playwork, sociology, anthropology and folklore, as well as to toy, museum, and landscape designers. This book will also be of help to parents, professional organizations, educators, and urban planners, with a postscript of concrete suggestions advocating for the essential role of play in a post-pandemic world."--Publisher's website.  0aPlay. 0aPlay assessment (Child psychology) 0aChildrenxRecreation. 0aCOVID-19 Pandemic, 2020-xSocial aspects.  0aCOVID-19 Pandemic, 2020-xPsychological aspects. 0aChildren and adults.1 aBeresin, Anna R.,eeditor.1 aBishop, Julia C.,d1960-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0326zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0326.jpgzConnect to cover image04155nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024603500220027204000210029404300120031510000340032724501240036126400470048526400110053230000620054333600260060533700260063133800360065750000440069350600480073753800360078554001840082150000650100550400690107050504120113952016690155165000260322065000460324665000680329265000750336065000200343565000190345571000380347485600570351285600920356999101361598970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         230703t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800649743 (hardback)  z9781800649736 (paperback)  a9781800649750q(pdf)  a9781800649798q(HTML)  a9781800649781q(XML)  a9781800649767q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1389615774  aStSaULbengerda  acl-----1 aPage, Joanna,d1974-eauthor.10aDecolonial ecologiesh[electronic resource] :bthe reinvention of natural history in Latin American art /cJoanna Page. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xviii, 278 pages) :b71 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)  license.

Page brings together an entirely new corpus of artistic projects from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru that engage critically and creatively with forms as diverse as the medieval bestiary, baroque cabinets of curiosities, atlases created by European travellers to the New World, the floras and herbaria composed by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century naturalists, and the dioramas designed for natural history museums. She explores how artists develop decolonial and post-anthropocentric perspectives on the collections and expeditions that were central to the evolution of European natural history. Their works forge a critique of the rationalizing approach to nature taken by modern Western science, reconnecting it with forms of popular, indigenous and spiritual knowledge and experience that it has systematically excluded since the Enlightenment. Drawing on photography, video, illustration, sculpture, and installation, this vividly illustrated and lucidly written book (also available in premium quality in hardback edition) explores how these artworks might also deconstruct the apocalyptic visions of environmental change that often dominate Western thought, developing a renewed understanding of alternative ways in which humans might co-inhabit the natural world."--Publisher's website.  0aArt, Latin American.  0aArt, ModernzLatin Americay20th century. 0aArtsxPolitical aspectszLatin AmericaxHistoryy20th century.  0aDecolonizationxSocial aspectszLatin AmericaxHistoryy20th century.  0aEcology in art. 0aNature in art.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0339zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0339.jpgzConnect to cover image04252nam a2200409 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016104000210018610000330020724500980024025000440033826400470038226400110042930000400044033600260048033700260050633800360053250000440056850600480061253800360066054001760069650000380087250400530091050512290096352013940219265000200358665000170360670000320362371000380365585600570369385600920375099101361605970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         230703t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111221 (hbk.)  z9781805111214 (pbk.)  a9781805111238q(pdf)  aStSaULbengerda1 aOsborne, Martin J.,eauthor.10aModels in microeconomic theoryh[electronic resource] /cMartin J.

Part I (Chapters 1-7) presents models of an economic agent, discussing abstract models of preferences, choice, and decision making under uncertainty, before turning to models of the consumer, the producer, and monopoly. Part II (Chapters 8-14) introduces the concept of equilibrium, beginning, unconventionally, with the models of the jungle and an economy with indivisible goods, and continuing with models of an exchange economy, equilibrium with rational expectations, and an economy with asymmetric information. Part III (Chapters 15-16) provides an introduction to game theory, covering strategic and extensive games and the concepts of Nash equilibrium and subgame perfect equilibrium. Part IV (Chapters 17-20) gives a taste of the topics of mechanism design, matching, the axiomatic analysis of economic systems, and social choice. The book focuses on the concepts of model and equilibrium. It states models and results precisely, and provides proofs for all results. It uses only elementary mathematics (with almost no calculus), although many of the proofs involve sustained logical arguments. It includes about 150 exercises. With its formal but accessible style, this textbook is designed for undergraduate students of microeconomics at intermediate and advanced levels."--Publisher's website. 0aMicroeconomics. 0aGame theory.1 aRubinstein, Ariel,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0361zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0361.jpgzConnect to cover image04292nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016103500220018604000210020810000330022924500980026225000430036026400470040326400110045030000400046133600260050133700260052733800360055350000440058950600480063353800360068154001830071750000380090050400530093850512290099152013940222065000200361465000170363470000320365171000380368385600570372185600920377899101361609970896620250606154156.0m     o  d        cr##n#########230703t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111252 (hbk.)  z9781805111245 (pbk.)  a9781805111269q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1150169822  aStSaULbengerda1 aOsborne, Martin J.,eauthor.10aModels in microeconomic theoryh[electronic resource] /cMartin J.

Tom was shot in the head by an Israeli soldier on 11 April 2003 whilst attempting to rescue two children trapped by Israeli sniper fire. He later died in hospital on 13 January 2004 without gaining consciousness. He is remembered for his determination to bear witness to the conflict in Palestine and his bravery to capture the atrocities directed towards the suppression of the Palestine people. This book is a collection of lectures written by reputable scholars who offer diverse perspectives on the historical, political and cultural struggles in Palestine. Encompassed in the pages are sixteen chapters produced for the Tom Hurndall Memorial Lecture Group. Unlike predecessors of this topic, this book offers a thought-provoking and comprehensive analysis of Palestine, including architectural, cultural, legal, sociological, and psychological questions, providing a larger scope of study that has not yet been done before. Ultimately, this book explores oppression in Palestine and beyond in the Middle East. The vast study and in-depth exploration makes this an ideal book for those who are interested in the Palestine conflict, Zionism, Israel and further conflict in the Middle East, as well as a necessity for those who are studying the topic in education settings."--Publisher's website. 10aHurndall, Tom,d1981-2004. 0aArab-Israeli conflict. 0aArab-Israeli conflicty1993-xPeace. 0aPalestinian ArabsxPolitics and governmenty20th century. 0aJewish nationalismzIsrael. 0aArab nationalismzGaza Strip. 0aArab nationalismzWest Bank. 0aMiddle EastxHistoryy20th century. 0aMiddle EastxPolitics and government.1 aParker, Ian,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0345zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0345.jpgzConnect to cover image03904nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024603500220027204000210029424501130031526400470042826400110047530000670048633600260055333700260057933800360060550000440064150600480068553800360073354001830076950001460095250400960109850510090119452009290220365000310313265000120316370000300317571000380320574000660324385600570330985600920336699101366135970896620250313114119.0m     o  d        cr  n         230714t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800649675 (hardback)  z9781800649668 (paperback)  a9781800649682q(pdf)  a9781800649729q(HTML)  a9781800649712q(XML)  a9781800649699q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1390452292  aStSaULbengerda00aHaving too muchh[electronic resource] :bphilosophical essays on limitarianism /cedited by Ingrid Robeyns. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (x, 404 pages) :b4 illustrations, 4 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

This concept has deep roots in economic and political thought. One can find similar statements of such limits in thinkers such as Plato, Aquinas, and Spinoza. But Having Too Much is the first time in contemporary political philosophy that limitarianism is explored at length and in detail. Bringing together in one place the best writing from key theorists of limitarianism, this book is an essential contribution to political philosophy in general, and theories of distributive justice in particular. Including some of the key published articles as well as new chapters, Having Too Much is necessary reading for scholars and students of political theory and philosophy, as well as anyone interested in questions of distributive justice."--Publisher's website.  0aLimitarianism (Philosophy) 0aWealth.1 aRobeyns, Ingrid,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.0 aTener demasiado : ensayos filosóficos sobre el limitarismo.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0338zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0338.jpgzConnect to cover image03437nam a2200409 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017003500220019504000210021710000280023824501270026626400470039326400110044030000390045133600260049033700260051633800360054250000440057850600480062253800360067054001490070650000650085550400550092050502340097552015410120965000400275065000240279065000260281471000380284085600570287885600920293599101368665970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         230714t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805110880 (hardback)  z9781805110873 (paperback)  a9781805110897q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1391693611  aStSaULbengerda1 aBaillot, Anne,eauthor.10aFrom handwriting to footprintingh[electronic resource] :btext and heritage in the age of climate crisis /cAnne Baillot. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (vi, 171 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

Conclusion / Anne Baillot.  a"How do we currently preserve and access texts, and will our current methods be sustainable in the future? In From Handwriting to Footprinting, Anne Baillot seeks to answer this question by offering a detailed analysis of the methods that enable access to textual materials, in particular, access to books of literary significance. Baillot marshals her considerable expertise in the field of digital humanities to establish a philological overview of the changing boundaries of 'access' to literary heritage over centuries, deconstructing the western tradition of archiving and how it has led to current digital dissemination practices. Rigorously examining the negative environmental impact of digital publishing and archiving, Baillot proposes an alternative model of preservation and dissemination which reconciles fundamental traditions with the values of social responsibility and sustainability in an era of climate crisis. Integrating historical, archival and environmental perspectives, From Handwriting to Footprinting illuminates the impact that digitisation has had on the dissemination and preservation of textual heritage and reflects on what its future may hold. It is invaluable reading for anyone interested in textual history from a linguistic or philological perspective, as well as those working on publishing, archival and infrastructure projects that require the storing and long-term preservation of texts, or who want to know how to develop a more mindful attachment to digitised material."--Publisher's website.  0aTransmission of textsxMethodology. 0aDigital humanities. 0aDigital preservation.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0355zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0355.jpgzConnect to cover image05749nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024603500220027204000210029404300130031510000370032824501060036526400470047126400110051830000660052933600260059533700260062133800360064750000440068350600480072753800360077554001660081150000650097750400520104250523620109452014500345665000520490665000410495865000520499965000410505171000380509285600570513085600920518799101376361970896620250313114125.0m     o  d        cr  n         230804t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805110330 (hardback)  z9781805110323 (paperback)  a9781805110347q(pdf)  a9781805110385q(HTML)  a9781805110378q(XML)  a9781805110354q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1392076774  aStSaULbengerda  ae--fr---1 aIsbell, John Claiborne,eauthor.10aDestins de femmesh[electronic resource] :bFrench women writers, 1750-1850 /cJohn Claiborne Isbell. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xv, 186 pages) :b30 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

John Isbell provides an essential collection that illuminates the impact women writers had on French literature and politics during a time marked by three revolutions, the influx of Romantic art, and rapid technological change. Each of the book's thirty chapters introduces a prominent work by a different female author writing in French during the period, from Germaine de Staël to George Sand, from the admired salon libertine Marie du Deffand to Flora Tristan, tireless campaigner for socialism and women's rights. Isbell draws from multi-genre writers working in prose, poetry and correspondence and addresses the breadth of women's contribution to the literature of the age. Isbell also details the important events which shaped the writers' lives and contextualises their work amidst the liberties both given and taken away from women during the period. This anthology fills a significant gap in the secondary literature on this transformative century, which often overlooks women who were working and active. It invites a further gendered investigation of the impact of revolution and Romanticism on the content and nature of French women's writing, and will therefore be appropriate for both general readers, students, and academics analysing history and literature through a feminist lens."--Publisher's website.  0aFrench literaturexWomen authorsy18th century. 0aWomen authors, Frenchy18th century. 0aFrench literaturexWomen authorsy19th century. 0aWomen authors, Frenchy19th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0346zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0346.jpgzConnect to cover image05265nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000300011102000300014102000250017102000260019602000250022202000260024703500220027304000210029524502390031626400470055526400110060230000670061333600260068033700260070633800360073250000440076850600480081253800360086054001830089650400520107950518340113152012920296565000310425765000410428865000270432970000320435670000310438870000290441970000320444870000300448070000290451070000330453971000380457285600570461085600920466799101376370970896620250313114122.0m     o  d        cr  n         230804t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z978180511061-3 (hardback)  z9781805110606 (paperback)  a9781805110620q(pdf)  a9781805110668q(HTML)  a9781805110651q(XML)  a9781805110637q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1396698038  aStSaULbengerda00aDigital transformationh[electronic resource] :bunderstanding business goals, risks, processes, and decisions /cMathias Cöster, Mats Danielson, Love Ekenberg, Cecilia Gullberg, Gard Titlestad, Alf Westelius, and Gunnar Wettergren. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xvi, 306 pages) :b49 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

This misconception can often lead to disarray and costly mistakes. Digital Transformation: Understanding Business Goals, Risks, Processes, and Decisions shows how to avoid such issues via careful consideration of what an enterprise really needs. Unlike many other books on digital transformation, the authors do not dwell on database design or the details of implementing information systems. Instead, they emphasise the importance of a clear understanding of all aspects of an organisation in order to effectively implement and manage digital systems, from business goals and strategies to structuring information and making decisions, risk assessments, project management, organising, and procuring services and products. Organised in eleven chapters, and drawing on examples from all over the world, this book will be of interest to university students of business administration, management, information systems, and computer science, as well as practitioners seeking to better understand how to handle digital transformation in their own organisation."--Publisher's website.  0aBusinessxData processing. 0aBusinessxTechnological innovations. 0aOrganizational change.1 aCöster, Mathias,eauthor.1 aDanielson, Mats,eauthor. 1 aEkenberg, Love,eauthor.1 aGullberg, Cecilia,eauthor.1 aTitlestad, Gard,eauthor.1 aWestelius, Alf,eauthor.1 aWettergren, Gunnar,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0350zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0350.jpgzConnect to cover image04171nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024603500220027204000210029404300210031510000310033624501590036726400470052626400110057330000590058433600260064333700260066933800360069550000440073150600480077553800360082354001830085950000650104250400550110750506150116252014930177765000640327065000640333465000580339865000580345671000380351485600570355285600920360999101386605970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         230815t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648364 (hardback)  z9781800648357 (paperback)  a9781800648371q(pdf)  a9781800648418q(HTML)  a9781800648401q(XML)  a9781800648388q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1392077433  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk---an-us---1 aAuspos, Patricia,eauthor.10aBreaking conventionsh[electronic resource] :bfive couples in search of marriage-career balance at the turn of the nineteenth century /cPatricia Auspos. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xvi, 456 pages) :b6 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

In all five marriages, both husband and wife enjoyed thriving professional lives: a shocking circumstance at a time when wealthy white married women were not supposed to have careers, and career women were not supposed to marry. Patricia Auspos examines what we can learn from the relationships of the Palmers, the Youngs, the Parsons, the Webbs, and the Mitchells, exploring the implications of their experiences for our understanding of the history of gender equality and of professional work. In expert and lucid fashion, Auspos draws out the interconnections between the institutions of marriage and professional life at a time when both were undergoing critical changes, by looking specifically at how a pioneering generation tried to combine the two. Based on extensive archival research and drawing on mostly unpublished letters, journals, pocket diaries, poetry, and autobiographical writings, Breaking Conventions tells the intimate stories of five path-breaking marriages and the social dynamics they confronted and revealed. This book will appeal to scholars, students, and anyone interested in women's studies, gender studies, masculinity studies, histories of women in the professions, and the history of marriage."--Publisher's website.  0aDual-career familieszGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century. 0aDual-career familieszUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aMarried peoplezGreat BritainxHistoryy19th century. 0aMarried peoplezUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0318zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0318.jpgzConnect to cover image03974nam a2200541 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000240016102000250018502000250021002000240023502200220025902200230028103500220030404000210032604300120034724501660035926400460052526400110057130000590058233600260064133700260066733800360069349000570072950000440078650600480083053800360087854001660091450000650108050400530114550501770119852015900137565000270296565000270299265000250301970000310304470000480307570000300312370000380315371000380319183000540322985600570328385600920334099101386633970896620250313114124.0m     o  d        cr  n         230815t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783744695 (hbk.)  z9781783744688 (pbk.)  a9781783744701 (pdf)  a9781783744718 (epub)  a9781783744725 (mobi)  z9781783745050 (XML)  z2050-7933 (Print)  a2054-362X (Online)  a(OCoLC)1392077571  aStSaULbengerda  af------00aFolktales of Mayotte, an African islandh[electronic resource] /cfrom research by Claude Allibert, Noel Gueunier, and Sophie Blanchy ; [foreword by Mark Turin]. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2023. 4c©2023  a1 online resource (vi, 192 pages) :b15 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aWorld oral literature seriesx2054-362X ;vvolume 10  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Relying on the researches of three French ethnographers who interviewed storytellers in the 1970s-80s, Lee Haring shows a once-colonised people using verbal art to preserve ancient values in the postcolonial world, when the island of Mayotte was transforming itself from a neglected colony to an overseas department of France. The author's innovation is to read ethnographic researches as play scripts-to see printed folktales as accounts of live performances. One storyteller after another comments symbolically on what it is like to be a formerly colonised population. Storytelling women, in particular, combine diverse plots and characters to create traditional-sounding stories, which could not have been predicted from the African, Malagasy, Indian, and European traditions coexisting in Mayotte. Haring's account shows them to be particularly skilled at irony and ambiguity, conveying both submissive and rebellious attitudes in their tales. He makes Mayotte storytelling accessible to a new, English-speaking audience and demonstrates that traditional storytellers in those years were preserving, but also critiquing, their inherited social order in a changing world.

'Seabirds in the North-East Atlantic' collates information from the scientific literature, non-governmental organisations' reports, conservation practitioner input and online databases into a single volume, and provides a reference manual to assist conservation planning. It is intended to be used by anyone who wishes to identify climate change threats to seabirds; to compare threats between different areas of the North-East Atlantic; to start a quantitative climate change vulnerability assessment for a local population; or to review options for conservation action in response to climate change.  This book stems from research published in December 2022, but assessments may be updated based on feedback and newly available information. To check for updates to our assessments, please visit our website at: www.ZSL.org/seabird-guidelines."--Publisher's website. 0aSea birdsxEffect of global warming onzAtlantic Ocean. 0aSea birdsxEffect of global warming onzEurope, Northern. 0aSea birdsxConservationzAtlantic Ocean. 0aSea birdsxConservationzEurope, Northern. 0aSea birdsxEcologyzAtlantic Ocean. 0aSea birdsxEcologyzEurope, Northern.1 aHäkkinen, Henry,eeditor.1 aPetrovan, Silviu O.,eeditor.1 aTaylor, N.

A Summary of the Argument Presented / Basem Adi.  a"This volume argues that relational realism can help us to make better educational policy that is more effective in practice. Basem Adi draws on critical realism to thoroughly re-examine fundamental assumptions about how government policymaking works, developing an ontological basis from which to examine existing government approaches and imagine an alternative approach based on a relational realist-informed critical pedagogy. Adi casts familiar issues in a new light by drawing on a less familiar theoretical and meta-theoretical tradition, offering a critique that can be productively engaged with by many educational organizations to tackle the issues they face. A Relational Realist Vision for Education Policy and Practice will be of great interest to academics of sociology, critical realism, sociological theory and education, as well as policymakers and educators seeking a theoretical perspective on their work."--Publisher's website. 0aEducation and state. 0aEducational change. 0aCritical pedagogy.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0327zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0327.jpgzConnect to cover image03955nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000250021202000260023703500220026304000210028524501500030626400470045626400110050330000580051433600260057233700260059833800360062450000440066050600480070453800360075254001660078850400510095450512200100552009690222565000220319465000260321665000240324265000200326670000360328671000380332285600570336085600920341799101391595970896620250313114119.0m     o  d        cr  n         230824t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805110958 (hbk.)  z9781805110941 (pbk.)  a9781805110965q(pdf)  a9781805111009q(HTML)  a9781805110996q(XML)  a9781805110972q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1395069057  aStSaULbengerda00aResearch, writing, and creative process in open and distance educationh[electronic resource] :btales from the field /cedited by Dianne Conrad. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xi, 226 pages) :b5 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Bringing together experts from many disciplines, it provides an accessible survey of what we know about these threats, how we can understand them better, and most importantly what can be done to manage them effectively. These essays pair insights from decades of research and activism around global risk with the latest academic findings from the emerging field of Existential Risk Studies. Voicing the work of world leading experts and tackling a variety of vital issues, they weigh up the demands of natural systems with political pressures and technological advances to build an empowering vision of how we can safeguard humanity's long-term future. The book covers both a comprehensive survey of how to study and manage global risks with in-depth discussion of core risk drivers: including environmental breakdown, novel technologies, global scale natural disasters, and nuclear threats. The Era of Global Risk offers a thorough analysis of the most serious dangers to humanity. Inspiring, accessible, and essential reading for both students of global risk and those committed to its mitigation, this book poses one critical question: how can we make sense of this era of global risk and move beyond it to an era of global safety?"--Publisher's website. 0aDisastersxRisk assessment. 0aEnvironmental disasters. 0aTechnologyxRisk assessment. 0aRisk assessment.1 aBeard, S.

His career extended from the Arts and Crafts movement of the late Victorian age to the Austerity aesthetics of the Second World War. Rejecting mass production and patronised by Royalty, Moorcroft's work was a synthesis of studio and factory, art and industry. He considered it his vocation to create an everyday art, both functional and decorative, affordable by more than a privileged few: 'If only the people in the world would concentrate upon making all things beautiful, and if all people concentrated on developing the arts of Peace, what a world it might be,' he wrote in a letter to his daughter in 1930. 'William Moorcroft, Potter: Individuality by Design' is a pioneering study by Jonathan Mallinson, Emeritus Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford. It follows the career of William Moorcroft through a wealth of private papers, letters and diaries, business correspondence and published reviews in newspapers, trade magazines and art journals. Richly illustrated with examples of his pottery, it explores what lay behind the unique impact of work sought by museums and treasured in homes the world over. The book examines an artist's very individual response to the turbulent half century in which he worked. It will appeal to both specialists and general readers with an interest in pottery, the decorative arts, and the cultural history of the times."--Publisher's website.10aMoorcroft, William,d1872-1945. 0aPottery, English. 0aPotteryzEnglandzStaffordshirexHistory.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0349zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0349.jpgzConnect to cover image03923nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000250021202000260023703500220026304000210028524501360030626400470044226400110048930000680050033600260056833700260059433800360062050000440065650600480070053800360074854001830078450400530096750510070102052009630202765000470299065000600303765000350309765000690313270000490320170000280325071000380327885600570331685600920337399101395950970896620250313114125.0m     o  d        cr  n         230908t20232023enka    sbg   001 0 eng d  z9781805110408 (hbk.)  z9781805110392 (pbk.)  a9781805110415q(pdf)  a9781805110453q(HTML)  a9781805110446q(XML)  a9781805110422q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1399167380  aStSaULbengerda00aCheap print and street literature of the long eighteenth centuryh[electronic resource] /cedited by David Atkinson and Steve Roud. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (viii, 388 pages) :b32 illustrations, music.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

Offering detailed studies of a selection of the printers, types of publication, and places of publication that constituted the cheap and popular print trade during the period, these essays delve into ballads, slip songs, story books, pictures, and more to push back against neat divisions between low and high culture, or popular and high literature. The breadth and depth of the contributions give a much fuller and more nuanced picture of what was being widely published and read during this period than has previously been available. It will be of great value to scholars and students of eighteenth-century popular culture and literature, print history and the book trade, ballad and folk studies, children's literature, and social history."--Publisher's website. 0aChapbooks, EnglishxHistoryy18th century. 0aBallads, EnglishzGreat BritainxHistory and criticism. 0aPrints, Englishy18th century. 0aBook industries and tradezGreat BritainxHistoryy18th century.1 aAtkinson, David,d1955 February 23-eeditor.1 aRoud, Stephen,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0347zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0347.jpgzConnect to cover image04130nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025504100130027610000380028924501540032726400470048126400110052830000600053933600260059933700260062533800360065149000670068750000440075450600480079853800360084654001660088250000700104850000920111850400530121054600410126350504100130452015340171465000320324865000360328071000750331671000380339183000560342985600570348585600940354299101395960970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         230908t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783749546 (hbk.)  z9781783749539 (pbk.)  a9781783749553q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1398181921  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaheb1 aKantor, Benjamin,d1990-eauthor.14aThe linguistic classification of the reading traditions of Biblical Hebrewh[electronic resource] :ba Phyla-and-Waves model /cBenjamin Paul Kantor. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xxii, 216 pages) :b3 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 19  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis text is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Relationship of the Reading Traditions / Benjamin Paul Kantor.  a"In recent decades, the field of Biblical Hebrew philology and linguistics has been witness to a growing interest in the diverse traditions of Biblical Hebrew. Indeed, while there is a tendency for many students and scholars to conceive of Biblical Hebrew as equivalent with the Tiberian pointing of the Leningrad Codex as it appears in Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS), there are many other important reading traditions attested throughout history. Origen's Secunda reflects a late Roman reading tradition of Biblical Hebrew transcribed into Greek letters. Occasional transcriptions of Biblical Hebrew into Latin letters in Jerome's commentaries similarly reflect a reading tradition from early Byzantine Palestine. In the medieval period, alongside Tiberian Hebrew we also find the Babylonian tradition and the Palestinian tradition. The modern oral reading tradition of the Samaritan community also likely has roots in the Second Temple period. Aside from these primary attestations of the reading traditions, there are a whole host of other modern reading traditions of Biblical Hebrew, from Ashkenazi, to Sephardi, and Yemenite. Despite the rich diversity of traditions of Biblical Hebrew at our fingertips, the linguistic relationship between them has never been mapped out. In this book, then, the phyla-and-waves methodology, which has been used for Semitic language classification, is used to map out the relationship between the main reading traditions of Biblical Hebrew throughout history."--Publisher's website.  0aHebrew languagexPhilology. 0aHebrew languagexPronunciation.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 19.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0210zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0210.jpgzConnect to cover image  04306nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000250021202000260023703500220026304000210028524502240030626400470053026400110057730000690058833600260065733700260068333800360070950000440074550600480078953800360083754001660087350400510103950508840109052009830197465000470295765000580300465000450306265000560310765000510316365000620321465000190327670000380329570000260333370000360335970000370339570000290343270000340346170000280349570000300352371000380355385600570359185600920364899101395971970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         230908t20232023enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805110170 (hbk.)  z9781805110163 (pbk.)  a9781805110576q(pdf)  a9781800649873q(HTML)  a9781805110507q(XML)  a9781783747894q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1401619156  aStSaULbengerda00aEthics of socially disruptive technologiesh[electronic resource] :ban introduction /cedited by Ibo van de Poel, Lily Frank, Julia Hermann, Jeroen Hopster, Dominic Lenzi, Sven Nyholm, Behnam Taebi, and Elena Ziliotti. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (viii, 178 pages) :b8 illustrations, 1 table.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

For example, social media challenges democracy; artificial intelligence raises the question of what is unique to humans; and the possibility to create artificial wombs may affect notions of motherhood and birth. Some have suggested that we address global warming by engineering the climate, but how does this impact our responsibility to future generations and our relation to nature? This book shows how technologies can be socially and conceptually disruptive and investigates how to come to terms with this disruptive potential. Four technologies are studied: social media, social robots, climate engineering and artificial wombs. The authors highlight the disruptive potential of these technologies, and the new questions this raises. The book also discusses responses to conceptual disruption, like conceptual engineering, the deliberate revision of concepts."--Publisher's website. 0aTechnological innovationsxSocial aspects. 0aTechnological innovationsxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aArtificial intelligencexSocial aspects. 0aArtificial intelligencexMoral and ethical aspects. 0aHuman reproductive technologyxSocial aspects. 0aHuman reproductive technologyxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aSocial change.1 aPoel, Ibo van de,d1966-eeditor.1 aFrank, Lily,eeditor.1 aHermann, Julia,d1979-eeditor.1 aHopster, Jeroen,d1987-eeditor.1 aLenzi, Dominic,eeditor.1 aNyholm, Sven,d1981-eeditor.1 aTaebi, Behnam,eeditor.1 aZiliotti, Elena,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0366zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0366.jpgzConnect to cover image05170nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000250021202000260023703500220026304000210028510000290030624501550033525000300049026400470052026400110056730000580057833600260063633700260066233800360068850000440072450600480076853800360081654001830085250000900103550000930112550400530121850511990127152017860247065000150425665000250427165000410429670000420433770000400437971000380441974000580445785600570451585600920457299101402782970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         230919t20232023enka    sb    001 0 dut d  z9781805110293 (hbk.)  z9781800648883 (pbk.)  a9781805110088q(pdf)  a9781805110361q(HTML)  a9781805110644q(XML)  a9781805111054q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1398518640  aStSaULbengerda1 aHens, Kristein,eauthor.10aToevallige ontmoetingenh[electronic resource] :bbio-ethiek voor een gehavende planeet /cKristein Hens ; [Christina Stadlbauer, Bart H.M.

Hun rol is behalve ethisch ook conceptueel: zij kunnen de kwaliteit en de coherentie van het wetenschappelijk onderzoek verbeteren door erop toe te zien dat specifieke concepten op een consistente en doordachte manier worden gebruik binnen interdisciplinaire projecten. Hens argumenteert dat toeval en onzekerheid een centrale rol spelen in de bio-ethiek, maar dat die in een spanningsrelatie kunnen raken met de pogingen om bepaalde theorieën ingang te doen vinden als wetenschappelijke kennis: bij het beschrijven van organismen en praktijken creëren we op een bepaalde manier de wereld. Hens stelt dat dit noodzakelijk een ethische activiteit betreft. Doorheen de verkenning van genetisch onderzoek, biomedische ethiek, autismeonderzoek en het concept 'risico' toont Hens aan dat er niet zoiets bestaat als 'universeel' of 'neutraal' wetenschappelijk of klinisch weten. Integendeel, uitgaan van de gesitueerdheid van individuele ervaringen is essentieel om de wereld rondom ons te begrijpen, om er de beperkingen van in te zien (en die van onszelf) en om een ethische toekomst vorm te geven. Toevallige ontmoetingen is gericht op een breed publiek van geïnteresseerden in bio-ethiek, filosofie, antropologie en sociologie, en op onderzoekers in biomedische en milieuwetenschappen. Daarnaast is het ook relevant voor beleidsmakers. De artistieke bijdrage van Christina Stadlbauer en Bartaku zal inspirerend zijn voor kunstenaars en schrijvers die zich op het snijvlak bewegen van kunst en wetenschappen."--Publisher's website. 0aBioethics. 0aBiologyxPhilosophy. 0aResearchxMoral and ethical aspects.1 aStadlbauer, Christina,eillustrator. 1 aVandeput, Bart H.

Pitcher.    a"This volume is the result of the 2021 session of the Linguistics and the Biblical Text research group of the Institute for Biblical Research, which addresses the history, relevance, and prospects of broad theoretical linguistic frameworks in the field of biblical studies. Cognitive Linguistics, Functional Grammar, generative linguistics, historical linguistics, complexity theory, and computational analysis are each allotted a chapter, outlining the key theoretical commitments of each approach, their major concepts and/or methods, and their important contributions to contemporary study of the biblical text. As academic disciplines and academic publishing proliferate and become more complex in a digital and global context, synthesising volumes such as this one have taken on new importance for both specialists and generalists alike. That is particularly the case in interdisciplinary areas of research. This volume therefore sets out to make linguistic theory clearer and more accessible to biblical scholars in particular, not only by careful explanation but also by specific illustration, drawing upon ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages within the Christian biblical corpus. The volume assists the reader in distinguishing the separate assumptions and scope of study for the separate theories, recognising methods of approach that can be applied to any of the theories, and the role of an umbrella theory to enable all the others to fruitfully interact. The bibliographies provided are structured for the non-specialist, noting handbooks, companions, and glossaries, general introductions, and foundational texts. In so doing, this volume presents not only a fully up-to-date cross-section of linguistic research in biblical scholarship but also an explicit path into the field, while highlighting important avenues for continued investigation and collaboration."--Publisher's website. 00aBiblexLanguage, style. 0aHebrew languagexGrammar, Historical. 0aLinguistics.1 aRoss, William A.,d1987-eeditor.1 aRobar, Elizabeth,eeditor.2 aInstitute for Biblical Research (Winona Lake, Ind.),ehost institution.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 20.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0358zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0358.jpgzConnect to cover image  04391nam a2200541 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000250021202000260023702200220026302200230028503500220030804000210033004300120035110000270036324501700039024600640056026400470062426400110067130000690068233600260075133700260077733800360080349000550083950000440089450600480093853800360098654001660102250400530118850507150124152013240195661000360328065000740331665000630339065000680345365100450352170000420356671000380360883000540364685600570370085600920375799101407639970896620250701142823.0m     o  d        cr##n#########231002t20232023enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800649132 (hbk.)  z9781800649125 (pbk.)  a9781800649149q(pdf)  a9781800649187q(HTML)  a9781800649170q(XML)  a9781800649156q(epub)  z2515-0758 (Print)  a2515-0766 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1401577408  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk---1 aFarmer, Paul,eauthor.10aAfter the miners' strikeh[electronic resource] :bA39 and Cornish political theatre versus Thatcher's Britain.nVolume 1/cPaul Farmer ; [preface, Rebecca Hillman].3 aA39 and Cornish political theatre versus Thatcher's Britain 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xii, 270 pages) :b30 illustrations, 1 table.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aApplied theatre praxis seriesx2515-0766 ;vvol. 3  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

The Tale of Trevithick's Tower / Paul Farmer, Mark Kilburn.  a"In this rich memoir, the first of two volumes, Paul Farmer traces the story of A39, the Cornish political theatre group he co-founded and ran from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. Farmer offers a unique insight into A39's creation, operation, and artistic practice during a period of convulsive political and social change. The reader is plunged into the national miners' strike and the collapse of Cornish tin mining, the impact of Thatcherism and 'Reaganomics', and the experience of touring Germany on the brink of reunification, alongside the influence on A39 of writers Bertolt Brecht, John McGrath and Keith Johnstone. Farmer, a former bus driver turned artistic director, details the theatre group's inception and development as it fought to break down social barriers, attract audiences, and survive with little more than a beaten-up Renault 12, a photocopier and two second-hand stage lights at its disposal: the book traces the progress from these raw materials to the development of an integrated community theatre practice for Cornwall. Farmer's candour and humour enliven this unique insight into 1980s theatre and politics. It will appeal to anyone with an interest in theatre history, life in Cornwall, and the relationship between performance and society during a turbulent era."--Publisher's website.20aA39 (Theater company)xHistory. 0aTheatrical companieszGreat BritainzCornwallxHistoryy20th century. 0aTheater and societyzGreat BritainxHistoryy20th century. 0aTheaterxPolitical aspectszGreat BritainxHistoryy20 century. 0aGreat BritainxSocial conditionsvDrama.1 aHillman, Rebecca,ewriter of preface.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aApplied theatre praxis series ;vv. 3.x2515-076640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0329zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0329.jpgzConnect to cover image05649nam a2200541 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200220020803500220023004000210025204100180027324501780029126400460046926400110051530000600052633600260058633700260061233800360063849000570067450000440073150600480077553800360082354001510085950400410101054600310105150516060108252017780268865000370446665000590450365000530456265000750461565000260469070000250471670000290474170000300477070000260480071000400482671000380486683000540490485600570495885600920501599101416445970896620250313114124.0m     o  d        cr  n         231006t20232023enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781800648012 (hbk.)  z9781800648005 (pbk.)  a9781800648029q(pdf)  z2050-7933 (Print)  a2054-362X(Online)  a(OCoLC)1402804683  aStSaULbengerda0 aengachiatib00aShépah[electronic resource] :bthe Tibetan oral tradition in Choné /cBendi Tso, Marnyi Gyatso, Naljor Tsering, Mark Turin and Members of the Choné Tibetan Community. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2023. 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xxii, 782 pages) :b7 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aWorld oral literature seriesx2054-362X ;vvolume 11  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a CC BY 4.0 DEED Attribution 4.0 International license.

A form of oral poetry sung antiphonally in a question-and-answer style. This book contains a unique collection of Tibetan oral narrations and songs known as Shépa, as these have been performed, recorded and shared between generations of Choné Tibetans from Amdo living in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Presented in trilingual format - in Tibetan, Chinese and English - the book reflects a sustained collaboration with and between members of the local community, including narrators, monks, and scholars, calling attention to the diversity inherent in all oral traditions, and the mutability of Shépa in particular. From creation myths to Bon and Buddhist cosmologies and even wedding songs, Shépa engages with and draws on elements of religious traditions, historical legacies and deep-seated cultural memories within Choné and Tibet, revealing the multi-layered conceptualization of the Tibetan physical world and the resilience of Tibetan communities within it. This vital and unique collection, part of the World Oral Literature Series, situates Shépa in its ethnographic context, offering insights into the preservation and revitalization of intangible cultural heritage in the context of cultural Tibet, Indigenous studies and beyond. Scholars and students in the fields of anthropology, linguistics, ethnic and minority relations, critical Indigenous studies, Tibetan studies, Himalayan studies, Asian studies and the broader study of China will find much to reward them in this book, as will all readers interested in the documentation and preservation of endangered oral traditions, intangible cultural heritage, performance and textuality, and Tibetan literature and religions."--Publisher's website. 0aFolk literature, TibetanvTexts. 0aFolk literature, TibetanzChinazAmdo (Region)vTexts. 0aFolk literature, TibetanxHistory and criticism. 0aFolk literature, TibetanzChinazAmdo (Region)xHistory and criticism. 0aFolk poetry, Tibetan.1 aTso, Bendi,eauthor.1 aGyatso, Marnyi,eauthor.1 aTsering, Naljor,eauthor.1 aTurin, Mark,eauthor.2 aChoné Tibetan Community,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWorld oral literature series ;vv. 11.x2054-362X40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0312zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0312.jpgzConnect to cover image03447nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000250021202000260023703500220026304000210028510000290030624501550033526400470049026400110053730000380054833600260058633700260061233800360063850000440067450600480071853800360076654001660080250400530096850503140102152013710133565000440270665000430275065000330279371000380282685600570286485600920292199101420306970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         231024t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805110477 (hbk.)  z9781805110460 (pbk.)  a9781805110484q(pdf)  a9781805110521q(HTML)  a9781805110514q(XML)  a9781805110491q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1404916023  aStSaULbengerda1 aMatthews, Paul,eauthor.10aTransparent minds in science fictionh[electronic resource] :ban introduction to accounts of alien, AI and post-human consciousness /cPaul Matthews. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (x, 134 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Paul Matthews expertly analyses the narratives of humans and nonhumans from Mary Shelley to Kazuo Ishiguro across 200 years of the genre. In doing so he gives lucid insight into the meaning of existence and self-awareness. Rigorously researched and highly accessible, Matthews argues that psycho-emotional science fiction writers both imitate and inform alien and post-human consciousnesses through exploratory narratives and metaphor. Drawing from a diverse range of scholars and critics, Matthews explores topics such as psychonarration and neuroaesthetics, to create a thoughtful and cogent argument. By synthesising concepts from philosophy, neuroscience, and literary theory, Matthews posits the potential for science fiction to bridge the gap in understanding between AI and human minds. Given the recent advancements in AI technology, Matthews' timely discussion enters the speculative realm of sentient technology and postcyborg ethics. The work constitutes a major contribution to cross-disciplinary perspectives on alien and posthuman psychology, that engages with future states of existence in both ourselves and the machines we create. Transparent Minds will be of interest to innovators, authors, and science fiction enthusiasts alike."--Publisher's website. 0aScience fictionxHistory and criticism. 0aArtificial intelligence in literature. 0aConsciousness in literature.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0348zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0348.jpgzConnect to cover image05260nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000250021202000260023703500220026304000210028510000390030624502210034526400470056626400110061330000560062433600260068033700260070633800360073250000440076850600480081253800360086054001680089650000650106450400530112950514320118252016330261465000450424765000500429265000750434270000320441770000330444970000320448270000260451470000270454071000380456785600570460585600920466299101420999970896620250313114123.0m     o  d        cr  n         231027t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111351 (hbk.)  z9781805111344 (pbk.)  a9781805111368q(pdf)  a9781805111405q(HTML)  a9781805111399q(XML)  a9781805111375q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1406070085  aStSaULbengerda1 aKoerber, Amyq(Amy Lunn),eauthor.14aThe predatory paradoxh[electronic resource] :bethics, politics, and practices in contemporary scholarly publishing /cAmy Koerber, Jesse C.

Upon a close examination, however, the definition of 'predatory' itself becomes slippery, evading neat boxes or lists which might seek to easily define and guard against it. This volume serves to foreground a nuanced representation of this multifaceted issue. In such a rapidly evolving landscape, this book becomes a field guide to its historical, political, and economic aspects, presenting thoughtful interviews, legal analysis and original research. Case studies from both European-American and non-European-American stakeholders emphasize the worldwide nature of the challenge faced by researchers of all levels. This coauthored book is structured into both textual and supplemental materials. Key takeaways, discussion questions, and complete classroom activities accompanying each chapter provide opportunities for engagement and real-world applications of these concepts. Crucially relevant to early career researchers and the senior faculty, library scholars, and administrators who mentor and support them, 'The Predatory Paradox: Ethics, Politics, and Practices in Contemporary Scholarly Publishing' offers practical recommendations for navigating the complex and often contradictory advice currently available. University instructors and teaching faculty will also find the reading essential in order to properly prepare both graduate and undergraduate students for the potential pitfalls endemic to scholarly publishing."--Publisher's website. 0aScholarly publishingxCorrupt practices. 0aPublishers and publishingxCorrupt practices. 0aCommunication in learning and scholarshipxMoral and ethical aspects. 1 aStarkey, Jesse C.,eauthor.1 aArdon-Dryer, Karin,eauthor.1 aCummins, R.

Thoughtfully edited by Laura Czerniewicz and Catherine Cronin, this rich and diverse collection by academics and professionals from across 17 countries and many disciplines offers a variety of answers to this question. It addresses the need to set new values for universities, trapped today in narratives dominated by financial incentives and performance indicators, and examines those "wicked" problems which need multiple solutions, resolutions, experiments, and imaginaries. This mix of new and well-established voices provides hopeful new ways of thinking about Higher Education across a range of contexts, and how to concretise initiatives to deal with local and global challenges. In an unusual and refreshing way, the contributors provide insights about resilience tactics and collective actions across different levels of higher education using an array of styles and formats including essays, poetry, and speculative fiction. With its interdisciplinary appeal, this book presents itself as a provocative and inspiring resource for universities, students, and scholars. Higher Education for Good courageously offers critique, hope, and purpose for the practice and the trajectory of Higher Education."--Publisher's website. 0aEducation, Higher.1 aCzerniewicz, Laura,eeditor.1 aCronin, Catherine,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0363zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0363.jpgzConnect to cover image03154nam a2200409 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016103500220018604000210020810000410022924501000027026400470037026400110041730000390042833600260046733700260049333800360051950000440055550600480059953800360064754001650068350000650084850400530091350505700096652008860153665000560242265000410247865000380251971000380255785600570259585600920265299101423221970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         231109t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783740512 (hbk.)  z9781800648814 (pbk.)  a9781805111382q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1408804092  aStSaULbengerda1 aWeizsäcker, Georg,d1973-eauthor.10aMisunderstandingsh[electronic resource] :bfalse beliefs in communication /cGeorg Weizsacker. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (vi, 128 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a CC BY-SA 4.0 Deed Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.

The book considers a wide set of two-person conversations, and a bit of game theory, to show how conversational statements and their interpretations are governed by beliefs. Thinking about beliefs is suitable for communication analysis because beliefs are well-defined and measurable, allowing to differentiate between successful understandings and their less successful counterparts: misunderstandings. The book describes the theoretical framework and empirical measurements of misunderstandings - written by an economist, but in simple words and using interdisciplinary concepts. The material will benefit students and researchers of behavioural economics and its neighbouring fields, and anyone interested in human language."--Publisher's website. 0aInterpersonal communicationxPsychological aspects. 0aConversationxPsychological aspects. 0aListeningxPsychological aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0367zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0367.jpgzConnect to cover image07115nam a2200649 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000250018603500220021104000210023310000390025424504800029326400470077326400110082030000410083133600260087233700260089833800360092450000440096050600480100453800360105254001690108850000650125750000510132250400510137350523240142452018060374860000490555460000670560370000300567070000300570070000260573070000280575670000340578470000290581870000270584770000290587470000310590370000340593470000300596870000450599870000380604370000310608170000340611270000280614670000320617470000340620670000380624071000380627885600570631685600920637399101430304970896620250313114124.0m     o  d        cr  n         231114t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648432 (hbk.)  z9781800648425 (pbk.)  a9781800648449q(pdf)  a9781800648470q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1409541102  aStSaULbengerda1 aReynolds, Matthew,d1969-eauthor.10aPrismatic Jane Eyreh[electronic resource] :bclose-reading a world novel across languages /cMatthew Reynolds with Andrés Claro, Annmarie Drury, Mary Frank, Paola Gaudio, Rebecca Ruth Gould, Jernej Habjan, Yunte Huang, Abhishek Jain, Eugenia Kelbert, Ulrich Timme Kragh, Ida Klitgård, Madli Kütt, Ana Teresa Marques dos Santos, Cláudia Pazos-Alonso, Eleni Philippou, Yousif M.

Conclusions / Matthew Reynolds.  a"Jane Eyre, written by Charlotte Brontë and first published in 1847, has been translated more than five hundred times into over sixty languages. Prismatic Jane Eyre argues that we should see these many re-writings, not as simple replications of the novel, but as a release of its multiple interpretative possibilities: in other words, as a prism.  Prismatic Jane Eyre develops the theoretical ramifications of this idea, and reads Brontë's novel in the light of them: together, the English text and the many translations form one vast entity, a multilingual world-work, spanning many times and places, from Cuba in 1850 to 21st-century China; from Calcutta to Bologna, Argentina to Iran. Co-written by many scholars, Prismatic Jane Eyre traces the receptions of the novel across cultures, showing why, when and where it has been translated (and no less significantly, not translated - as in Swahili), and exploring its global publishing history with digital maps and carousels of cover images. Above all, the co-authors read the translations and the English text closely, and together, showing in detail how the novel's feminist power, its political complexities and its romantic appeal play out differently in different contexts and in the varied styles and idioms of individual translators. Tracking key words such as 'passion' and 'plain' across many languages via interactive visualisations and comparative analysis, Prismatic Jane Eyre opens a wholly new perspective on Brontë's novel, and provides a model for the collaborative close-reading of world literature.  Prismatic Jane Eyre is a major intervention in translation and reception studies and world and comparative literature. It will also interest scholars of English literature, and readers of the Brontës."--Publisher's website.10aBrontë, Charlotte,d1816-1855.tJane Eyre.10aBrontë, Charlotte,d1816-1855xCriticism and interpretation.1 aClaro, Andrés,eauthor.1 aDrury, Annmarie,eauthor.1 aFrank, Mary,eauthor.1 aGaudio, Paola,eauthor.1 aGould, Rebecca Ruth,eauthor.1 aHabjan, Jernej,eauthor.1 aHuang, Yunte,eauthor.1 aJain, Abhishek,eauthor.1 aKelbert, Eugenia,eauthor.1 aKragh, Ulrich Timme,eauthor.1 aKlitgård, Ida,eauthor.1 aMarques dos Santos, Ana Teresa,eauthor.1 aPazos-Alonso, Cláudia,eauthor.1 aPhilippou, Eleni,eauthor.1 aQasmiyeh, Yousif M.,eauthor.1 aRychen, Léa,eauthor.1 aSabiron, Céline,eauthor.1 aTahmasebian, Kayvan,eauthor.1 aVitali, Giovanni Pietro,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0319zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0319.jpgzConnect to cover image04274nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000270011102000270013802000250016502000260019002000250021602000260024103500220026704000210028910000630031024501430037324600530051626400470056926400110061630000620062733600260068933700260071533800360074150000440077750600480082153800360086954001660090550001760107150000650124750400670131250504390137952015710181865000600338965000380344965000620348771000380354974000560358785600570364385600920370099101433555970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         231120t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  q9781800649538z (hbk.)  q9781800649521z (pbk.)  a9781800649545q(pdf)  a9781800649583q(HTML)  a9781800649576q(XML)  a9781800649552q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1410495971  aStSaULbengerda1 aIngram, Davidc(Professor of health informatics),eauthor.00aHealth care in the information society.nVol. 1,pFrom adventure of ideas to anarchy of transitionh[electronic resource] /cDavid Ingram.3 aFrom adventure of ideas to anarchy of transition 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xxxiv, 476 pages) :b11 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Indeed, it has long been acknowledged by scholars that the Hebrew grammatical tradition, in many ways, grew up out of and alongside the Arabic grammatical tradition. Many concepts present in Hebrew grammar have their origins in the writings of Arabic grammarians of the ʿAbbasid period. And yet, as recent linguistic and anthropological work has shown, setting down 'the grammar' of a language can be as much an ideological or political activity as an academic one. In addition to the language itself, speech communities also share beliefs and attitudes about that language-what linguistic anthropologists would term a 'language ideology'. Language ideology can have a dramatic impact on what forms of the language one regards as acceptable and what sort of rules one imposes on and through their description of the language. Nevertheless, while much work has been done on the interface between Hebrew and Arabic grammar and literature in the Middle Ages, interface of their respective language ideologies has yet to be treated theoretically or systematically. In the present book, then, we survey six specific characteristics of a 'standard language ideology' that appear in both the writings of the Hebrew grammarians who wrote in Judeo-Arabic and the Arabic grammarians during the ʿAbbasid period. Such striking lines of linguistic-ideological similarity suggest that it may not have been only grammatical concepts or literary genres that the medieval Hebrew grammarians inherited from the Arabic grammatical tradition, but a way of thinking about language as well."--Publisher's website.  0aHebrew language, BiblicalxGrammar. 0aHebrew language, BiblicalxHistory.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 21.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0382zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0382.jpgzConnect to cover image  04612nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000250022102000260024603500220027204000210029424501900031524600450050524600390055026400460058926400110063530000720064633600260071833700260074433800360077050000440080650600480085053800360089854001680093450515410110252011680264365000290381165000320384070000340387270000340390670000270394071000380396785600570400585600920406299101448960970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         231212t20232023enkad   sb    000 0deng d  z9781805112013 (Hardback)  z9781805112006 (Paperback)  a9781805112020q(pdf)  a9781805112051q(HTML)  a9781805112051q(XML)  a9781805112037q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1414210799  aStSaULbengerda00aFinancing investment in times of high public debth[electronic resource] :b2023 European public investment outlook /cedited by Floriana Cerniglia, Francesco Saraceno, and Andrew Watt.30a2023 European public investment outlook 30aEuropean public investment outlook 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2023. 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xiv, 234 pages) :b52 illustrations, 17 tables.   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Drawing on expertise from academics, researchers at public policy institutes and international governance bodies, the contributors analyse the current situation and prospects and propose feasible solutions. Financing Investment in Times of High Public Debt offers a powerful combination of high-level analysis of cross-continental policies and trends, with close examination of specific contexts in France, Italy, Germany and Spain. The chapters in Part II explore challenges including how to finance climate investments, the extent to which national promotional banks can offer solutions, EU budget reform and recent trends in tax progressivity.

Central to DH research is the practice of modelling, which involves translating intricate knowledge systems into computational models. This book addresses a fundamental query: How can an effective language be developed to conceptualize and guide modelling in DH? Modelling, with its historical roots, carries multifaceted meanings influenced by various disciplinary contexts. Modelling Between Digital and Humanities innovatively connects DH with the historical tradition of model-based thinking in the humanities, cultural studies, and the sciences. It endeavors to reshape interpretative frameworks by contextualizing DH's modelling practices within a broader conceptual landscape. Through an exploration of digital, visual and data models, the book asserts that DH holds the potential to be a cornerstone of a novel cultural literacy paradigm. By probing the interplay between technology and thought, the book ultimately positions DH as a catalyst for transformative cultural insight"--Publisher's website. 0aDigital humanities.1 aEide, Øyvind,eauthor.1 aMarras, Cristina,eauthor.1 aSahle, Patrick,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0369zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0369.jpgzConnect to cover image04743nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025504100180027624501410029426400470043526400110048230000610049333600260055433700260058033800360060649000670064250000440070950600480075353800360080154001610083750000700099850000920106850400530116054600520121350510130126552014190227865000490369765000370374665000510378370000410383470000300387571000750390571000380398083000560401885600570407485600940413199101456294970896620250313114119.0m     o  d        cr  n         240104t20232023enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800649163 (hbk.)  z9781805111184 (pbk.)  a9781805111481q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1415825306  aStSaULbengerda0 aengasyraara00aSynopses and listsh[electronic resource] :btextual practices in the pre-modern word /cedited by Teresa Bernheimer and Ronny Vollandt. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (xxii, 386 pages) :b28 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 22  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NoDerivs 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0) license.

Among the most intriguing are synopses and lists. While lists provide a complete enumeration of ideas, people, events, or terms, synopses juxtapose one against the other. To understand how they were planned, produced, and consumed, is to gain insight into the practices of what one can call management of knowledge in a time before our own. The present volume is the product of two workshops held in 2019 and 2021 as part of the research focus Textual Practices in the Pre-Modern World: Texts and Ideas between Aksum, Constantinople, and Baghdad, which was generously supported and funded by the Centre for Advanced Study (CAS) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU), Munich. Aiming to understand how synopses and lists function in the literatures of the great intellectual traditions of late antiquity-the ancient Near East, ancient philosophy, and the three monotheistic religions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-the volume offers a historical and transcultural perspective on synopses and lists, highlighting the centrality of these textual practices to allow storing, retrieving, selecting, and organising this knowledge. Both make deliberate - yet not always explicit - choices as to what is included and excluded, thereby creating lasting hierarchies and canon."--Publisher's website.  0aTransmission of textszMiddle EastxHistory. 0aParatextzMiddle EastxHistory.  0aMiddle Eastern literaturexCriticism, Textual.1 aBernheimer, Teresa,d1978-eeditor. 1 aVollandt, Ronny,eeditor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 22.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0375zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0375.jpgzConnect to cover image  04271nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000330028124501150031426400470042926400110047630000390048733600260052633700260055233800360057850000440061450600480065853800360070654001660074250400530090850519140096152005880287560000630346360000450352660000430357165000360361471000380365085600570368885600920374599101456436970896620250313114122.0m     o  d        cr  n         240105t20232023enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800643017 (hbk.)  z9781800643000 (pbk.)  a9781800644137q(pdf)  a9781800646735q(HTML)  a9781800644144q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1415825327  aStSaULbengerda1 aHutchings, William,eauthor.10a'Wit's wild dancing light'h[electronic resource] :breading the poems of Alexander Pope /cWilliam Hutchings. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2023] 4c©2023  a1 online resource (vi, 306 pages)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Each of the 26 chapters forming the volume selects examples for detailed scrutiny, demonstrating how close reading can generate understanding of a whole poem and how critical appraisal can build into a creative survey of an entire poetic career. The book's approach is intended to be both scholarly and accessible and 'Wit's Wild Dancing Light' will be of interest to scholars, students and anybody interested in Pope's masterful poetry."--Publisher's website.10aPope, Alexander,d1688-1744xCriticism and interpretation.10aPope, Alexander,d1688-1744xTechnique. 10aPope, Alexander,d1688-1744xLanguage. 0aPoeticsxHistoryy18th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0372zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0372.jpgzConnect to cover image04678nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000420028124501050032326400470042826400110047530000730048633600260055933700260058533800360061150000440064750600480069153800360073954001660077550002440094150400530118550504290123850506660166752015290233360000610386260000410392363000440396463000250400871000380403385600570407185600920412899101470332970896620250313114125.0m     o  d        cr  n         240116t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111023 (hbk.)  z9781805111016 (pbk.)  a9781805111030q(pdf)  a9781805111078q(HTML)  a9781805111047q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1417637777  aStSaULbengerda1 aDobbs-Allsopp, F.

However, a study has yet to elucidate the precise manner in which the Bible has shaped Whitman's poetic style. This is the deficit that F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp seeks to address in his new piece of literary scholarship: 'Divine Style: Walt Whitman and the King James Bible'. Dobbs-Allsopp, Professor of Old Testament at Princeton Theological Seminary, explicitly approaches Whitman from the perspective of a biblical scholar. Utilising his wealth of expertise in this field, he constructs a compelling, erudite and methodical argument for the King James Bible's importance in the evolution of Whitman's style - from his signature long lines to the prevalence of parallelism and tendency towards parataxis in his works. 'Divine Style' focuses on Whitman's output in the years preceding the release of his 1855 opus 'Leaves of Grass' through the general period of the book's first three editions. In this, Dobbs-Allsopp's exploration of the period is exhaustive - covering not just Leaves of Grass but recently recovered notebooks, newly digitised manuscripts and additions to the corpus, such as the novel 'Life and Adventures of Jack Engle'.

It traces innovations within classical music practice, showing how these offer divergent visions for its future. The interdisciplinary contributions to the volume highlight the way contrasting ideas of the future can effect change in the present. A rich balance of theoretical and practical discussion brings authority to this collection, which lays the foundations for timely responses to challenges ranging from the concept of the musical work, and the colonial values within Western musical culture, to unsustainable models of orchestral touring. The authors highlight how labour to meet the demands of particular futures for classical music might impact its creation and consumption, presenting case studies to capture the mediating roles of technology and community engagement. This book will be of interest to scholars and students in the fields of musicology and the sociology of music, as well as a general audience of practitioners, freelance musicians, music administrators and educators."--Publisher's website. 0aMusicxSocial aspects. 0aMusicxTechnological innovations. 0aMusicology.1 aSmith, Neil Thomas,eeditor.1 aPeters, Peter,d1957-eeditor.1 aMolina, Karoly,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0353zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0353.jpgzConnect to cover image03847nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031410000670033524501320040226400460053426400110058030000400059133600260063133700260065733800360068349000430071950000440076250600480080653800360085454001780089050400530106850507010112152012100182263000270303263000230305963000320308265000250311471000380313983000380317785600580321585600920327399101489890970896620250313114126.0m     o  d        cr  n         240209t20242024enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111771 (Hardback)  z9781805111764 (Paperback)  a9781805111788q(pdf)  a9781805111818q(HTML)  a9781805111795q(EPUB)  z2753-8036 (Print)  z2753-8044 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1422039684  aStSaULbengerda1 aI︠A︡kubovych, M.

From the first attempts at translation in the mid-twentieth century to more recent state-driven efforts concerned with international impact, The Kingdom and the Qur'an adeptly elucidates the link between contemporary Islamic theology and the advent of modern print culture. It investigates this critical juncture in both Middle Eastern political history and the intellectual evolution of the Muslim world, interweaving literary, socio-historical, and socio-anthropological threads to depict the intricate backdrop of the Saudi 'Qur'an translation movement'. Mykhaylo Yakubovych provides a comprehensive historical overview of the debates surrounding the translatability of the Qur'an, as well as exploring the impact of the burgeoning translation and dissemination of the holy book upon Wahhabi and Salafi interpretations of Islam. Backed by meticulous research and drawing on a wealth of sources, this work illuminates an essential facet of global Islamic culture and scholarly discourse."--Publisher's website.00aQurʼanvTranslating. 00aQurʼanvTheology.00aQur'anxStudy and teaching. 0aIslamzSaudi Arabia.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aGlobal Qur'an ;vv. 2.x2753-804440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0381zConnect to e-book 42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0381.jpgzConnect to cover image03817nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004100130028110000610029424501920035526400470054726400110059430000740060533600260067933700260070533800360073150000440076750600480081153800360085954002000089550400670109554600330116250503710119552014640156665000200303065000180305065000260306865000350309470000310312971000380316085600570319885600920325599101489912970896620250313114123.0m     o  d        cr  n         240209t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111597 (hbk.)  z9781805111580 (pbk.)  a9781805111603q(pdf)  a9781805111634q(HTML)  a9781805111610q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1422039773  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghrus1 aTarasov, O.

While these two developments are well-known, they are usually studied in isolation. Tarasov's study has the great merit of showing the connection between the art world in Russia and the West, and its impact in the cultural history of the continent in the pre-war period. Drawing on a profound familiarity with Russian sources, some of which are little known to Western scholars, and on equally expert knowledge of Western material and scholarship, Oleg Tarasov presents a fresh perspective on early twentieth-century Russian and Western art. The author demonstrates that during the Belle Époque, the interest in medieval Russian icons and Italian 'primitives' lead to the recognition of both as distinctive art forms conveying a powerful spiritual message. Formalist art theory and its influence on art collecting played a major role in this recognition of aesthetic and moral value of 'primitive' paintings, and was instrumental in reshaping the perception of divine images as artworks. Ultimately, this monograph represents a significant contribution to our understanding of early twentieth-century art; it will be of interest to art scholars, students and anyone interested in the spiritual and aesthetic revival of religious paintings in the Belle Époque."--Publisher's website. 0aIcons, Russian. 0aArt, Russian. 0aArt, MedievalzItaly. 0aArt, Early RenaissancezItaly.1 aRock, Stella,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0378zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0378.jpgzConnect to cover image07811nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000340031524502750034924600440062426400460066826400110071430000550072533600260078033700260080633800360083250000440086850600480091253800360096054001650099650400690116150541170123052016540534765000190700170000340702070000310705470000310708570000380711671000380715485600570719285600920724999101490037970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         200807t20202020enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783749249 (Hardback)  z9781783749232 (Paperback)  a9781783749256q(pdf)  a9781783749263q(epub)  a9781783749270q(mobi)  a9781783749287q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1229546546  aStSaULbengerda1 aBonvillian, John D.,eauthor.10aSimplified signsh[electronic resource] :ba manual sign-communication system for special populations.nVolume 1,pPrinciples, background, and application /cJohn D.

It is the culmination of over twenty years of research and development by the authors. The Simplified Sign System has been developed and tested for ease of sign comprehension, memorization, and formation by limiting the complexity of the motor skills required to form each sign, and by ensuring that each sign visually resembles the meaning it conveys. Volume 1 outlines the research underpinning and informing the project, and places the Simplified Sign System in a wider context of sign usage, historically and by different populations. Volume 2 presents the lexicon of signs, totalling approximately 1000 signs, each with a clear illustration and a written description of how the sign is formed, as well as a memory aid that connects the sign visually to the meaning that it conveys. While the Simplified Sign System originally was developed to meet the needs of persons with intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy, autism, or aphasia, it may also assist the communication needs of a wider audience - such as healthcare professionals, aid workers, military personnel , travellers or parents, and children who have not yet mastered spoken language.  The system also has been shown to enhance learning for individuals studying a foreign language. Lucid and comprehensive, this work constitutes a valuable resource that will enhance the communicative interactions of many different people, and will be of great interest to researchers and educators alike."--Publisher's website. 0aSign language.1 aLee, Nicole Kissane,eeditor.1 aDooley, Tracy T.,eeditor.1 aLoncke, Filip T.,eeditor.1 aNelson-Metlay, Val,eillustrator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0205zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0205.jpgzConnect to cover image04057nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102000250024703500220027204000210029410000340031524502900034924600590063926400460069826400110074430000580075533600260081333700260083933800360086550000440090150600480094553800360099354001650102950000220119450503770121652016540159365000190324770000340326670000310330070000310333170000380336271000380340085600570343885600920349599101490544970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         200813t20202020enka    s     001 0 eng d  z9781783640009 (Hardback)  z9781783749997 (Paperback)  a9781800640016q(pdf)  a9781800640023q(epub)  a9781800640030q(mobi)  a9781800640047q(XML)  a(OCoLC)1130040848  aStSaULbengerda1 aBonvillian, John D.,eauthor.10aSimplified signsh[electronic resource] :ba manual sign-communication system for special populations.nVolume 2,pSimplified sign lexicon, descriptions, and memory aids /cJohn D.

It is the culmination of over twenty years of research and development by the authors. The Simplified Sign System has been developed and tested for ease of sign comprehension, memorization, and formation by limiting the complexity of the motor skills required to form each sign, and by ensuring that each sign visually resembles the meaning it conveys. Volume 1 outlines the research underpinning and informing the project, and places the Simplified Sign System in a wider context of sign usage, historically and by different populations. Volume 2 presents the lexicon of signs, totalling approximately 1000 signs, each with a clear illustration and a written description of how the sign is formed, as well as a memory aid that connects the sign visually to the meaning that it conveys. While the Simplified Sign System originally was developed to meet the needs of persons with intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy, autism, or aphasia, it may also assist the communication needs of a wider audience - such as healthcare professionals, aid workers, military personnel , travellers or parents, and children who have not yet mastered spoken language.  The system also has been shown to enhance learning for individuals studying a foreign language. Lucid and comprehensive, this work constitutes a valuable resource that will enhance the communicative interactions of many different people, and will be of great interest to researchers and educators alike."--Publisher's website. 0aSign language.1 aLee, Nicole Kissane,eauthor.1 aDooley, Tracy T.,eauthor.1 aLoncke, Filip T.,eauthor.1 aNelson-Metlay, Val,eillustrator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0220zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0220.jpgzConnect to cover image04282nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026013000300028124501790031126400470049026400110053730000390054833600260058733700260061333800360063950000440067550600480071953800360076754001800080350001420098350400670112550510780119252011430227065000310341365000120344470000310345670000360348770000410352371000380356474000610360285600570366385600920372099101493239970896620250313114124.0m     o  d        cr  n         240220t20242024enk     sb    001 0 spa d  z9781805110811 (hbk.)  z9781805110804 (pbk.)  a9781805110828q(pdf)  a9781805110866q(HTML)  a9781805110835q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1422929642  aStSaULbengerda0 aHaving too much.lSpanish00aTener demasiadoh[electronic resource] :bensayos filosóficos sobre el limitarismo /ceditado por Ingrid Robeyns ; traducción por Héctor Iñaki, Larrínaga Márquez. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xii, 448 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 Deed Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International license.

Se trata de un concepto profundamente arraigado en el pensamiento económico y político, por lo que es posible encontrar premisas similares en pensadores como Platón, Aquino o Spinoza. No obstante, 'Tener demasiado' es el primer ejemplar en el campo de la filosofía política contemporánea en el que el limitarismo se explora en profundidad y con detalle. Asimismo, este estudio reúne por primera vez los mejores escritos de los principales teóricos del limitarismo, lo que le convierte en una contribución esencial al campo de la filosofía política, en general, y de las teorías sobre la justicia distributiva, en particular. Incluye tanto artículos seminales ya publicados como nuevos capítulos y se presenta como lectura indispensable para académicos y estudiantes de teoría política y filosofía, así como para todos aquellos interesados en cuestiones relacionadas con la justicia distributiva."--Publisher's website. 0aLimitarianism (Philosophy) 0aWealth.1 aRobeyns, Ingrid,eeditor. 1 aIñaki, Héctor,etranslator.1 aMárquez, Larrínaga,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.0 aHaving too much : philosophical essays on limitarianism.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0354zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0354.jpgzConnect to cover image04036nam a2200397 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000410028124500940032226400470041626400110046330000680047433600260054233700260056833800360059450000440063050600480067453800360072254001660075850400530092450512590097752011550223660000600339171000380345185600570348985600920354699101497219970896620250313114123.0m     o  d        cr  n         240227t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648852 (hbk.)  z9781800648845 (pbk.)  a9781800648869q(pdf)  a9781800648906q(HTML)  a9781800648876q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1423523858  aStSaULbengerda1 aGabler, Hans Walter,d1938-eauthor.10aGenetic inroads into the art of James Joyceh[electronic resource] /cHans Walter Gabler. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (vi, 452 pages) :b9 illustrations, 2 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Word known to all men.' / Hans Walter Gabler -- Ulysses 1984: To Edit and Read in Flow of Composition / Hans Walter Gabler.  a"This book is a treasure trove comprising core writings from Hans Walter Gabler's seminal work on James Joyce, spanning fifty years from the analysis of composition he undertook towards a critical text of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, through the Critical and Synoptic Edition of Ulysses, to Gabler's latest essays on (appropriately enough) Joyce's sustained artistic innovation. Not only does this span of essays trace the evolution of Gabler's thinking about Joyce's originality and creative energy. It also reflects the development and maturation of Gabler's own genetic criticism and his methodology of genetic editing, which grows in depth and complexity across the collection. The reader will explore Joyce's life and works through Gabler's incisive eye, while also examining a progress of his reflections on his edition of Ulysses and the past controversy that beset it. This classic compendium combining well-seasoned scholarship and fresh criticism is an essential read for critics of Modernism, digital humanists, scholars and students of James Joyce, and anyone interested in the art of literary analysis."--Publisher's website.10aJoyce, James,d1882-1941xCriticism and interpretation.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0325zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0325.jpgzConnect to cover image06253nam a2200553 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025524502480027626400470052426400110057130000690058233600260065133700260067733800360070349000660073950000440080550600480084953800360089754001650093350000700109850400410116850523120120952015240352160000380504565000310508365000310511465000210514565000510516665000660521770000290528370000280531270000270534070000320536770000320539970000260543171000380545783000550549585600570555085600920560799101498109970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         200818t20202020enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783749683 (hbk.)  z9781783749676 (pbk.)  a9781783749690q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1229636858  aStSaULbengerda00aJewish-Muslim intellectual history entangledh[electronic resource] :btextual materials from the Firkovitch Collection, Saint Petersburg /cedited by Camilla Adang, Bruno Chiesa, Omar Hamdan, Wilferd Madelung, Sabine Schmidtke and Jan Thiele. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (504 pages) :b18 illustrations (some colour)   atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 4  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Consigned to oblivion for centuries, many of these manuscripts were sold in the second half of the nineteenth century to the National Library of Russia in St Petersburg, where they remained inaccessible to most scholars until the end of the Cold War. The texts from the Karaite library cover a remarkable spectrum of medieval literary genres and scholarly disciplines, spanning works by Jewish, Muslim and Christian authors, in both Hebrew and Arabic. As such, they provide unique access to an otherwise lost body of literature from the medieval Islamicate world. This timely volume presents, for the first time, edited fragments of six texts by adherents of the Muʿtazila, a school of rational theology that emerged in the eighth century CE, including Karaite copies and recensions of works by Muslim authors, notably ʿAbd al-Jabbār al-Hamadhānī and ʿAbd Allāh b. Saʿīd al-Labbād, as well as original Jewish Muʿtazilī treatises. The collection is concluded by an anonymous Rabbanite refutation of the highly influential polemical tract against Judaism, entitled Ifḥām al-yāhūd. This collection offers unprecedented insights into the intellectual crossroads between Muslims and Jews of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It will be an invaluable resource to students and scholars engaged with this period of history."--Publisher's website. 10aFirkowitsch, Abraham,d1786-1874. 0aJudaismxRelationsxIslam. 0aIslamxRelationsxJudaism. 0aIslamxTheology. 0aIslamxManuscriptsxCollectors and collecting. 0aManuscriptsxCollectors and collectingzRussiazSt Petersburg1 aAdang, Camilla,eeditor.1 aChiesa, Bruno,eeditor.1 aHamdan, Omar,eeditor.1 aMadelung, Wilferd,eeditor.1 aSchmidtke, Sabine,eeditor.1 aThiele, Jan,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 4.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0214zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0214.jpgzConnect to cover image03954nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004100130028110000350029424501540032926400470048326400110053030000670054133600260060833700260063433800360066050000440069650600480074053800360078854001660082450400810099054600440107150509470111552009940206265000330305665000400308965000390312965000430316865100410321170000330325271000380328585600570332385600920338099101505194970896620250313114123.0m     o  d        cr  n         240312t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112075 (hbk.)  z9781805112068 (pbk.)  a9781805112082q(pdf)  a9781805112112q(HTML)  a9781805112099q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1425376733  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghspa1 aMyers, Kathleen Anne,eauthor.12aA country of shepherdsh[electronic resource] :bstories of a changing Mediterranean landscape /cKathleen Ann Myers ; translations by Grady C.

Their narratives highlight how local practices interact with regional and European communities and policies, and they help us see a broader role for extensive grazing practices and sustainability. A Country of Shepherds is timely, reflecting the growing interest in ecological farming methods as well as the Spanish government's recent work with UNESCO to recognise the seasonal movement of herd animals in the Iberian Peninsula as an Intangible Cultural Heritage. Demonstrating the critical role of tradition, cultural geographies, and sustainability in the Mediterranean, this book will appeal to academicians but also to general readers who seek to understand, in very human terms, the impact of the world-wide environmental crisis we are now experiencing."--Publisher's website. 0aShepherdszSpainzAndalusia. 0aPastoral systemszSpainzAndalusia. 0aLand use, RuralzSpainzAndalusia. 0aAnimal culturezEnvironmental aspects. 0aAndalusia (Spain)zRural conditions.1 aWray, Grady C.,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0387zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0387.jpgzConnect to cover image03740nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028110000290029324501120032226400470043426400110048130000640049233600260055633700260058233800360060850000440064450600480068853800360073654001660077250000650093850400530100350504040105652014930146060000290295365000450298265000230302765000450305071000380309585600570313385600920319099101505677970896620250313114126.0m     o  d        cr  n         240314t20242024enka    sb    001 0beng d  z9781805112341 (hbk.)  z9781805112334 (pbk.)  a9781805112358q(pdf)  a9781805112389q(HTML)  a9781805112365q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1426006311  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk-en1 aHowsam, Leslie,eauthor.10aEliza Orme's ambitionsh[electronic resource] :bpolitics and the law in Victorian London /cLeslie Howsam. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (x, 166 pages) :b9 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Eliza Orme, despite becoming the first woman in Britain to earn a university degree in Law in 1888, leading both a political organization and a labour investigation in 1892, and participating actively in the women's suffrage movement into the early twentieth century, is one such figure. Framed as a 'research memoir', Eliza Orme's Ambitions fills out earlier scant accounts of this intriguing life, while speculating about why it has been overlooked. Established historian Leslie Howsam shapes the story around her own persistent curiosity in the context of a transformed research landscape, where important letters and explosive newspaper accounts have only recently come to light. These materials show how Orme's career ambitions brought her into conflict with the male-dominated legal community of her time, while her political ambitions were cut short by disputes with other women activists whose notions of political strategy she repudiated. In public, Orme was a formidable debater for the causes she supported and against opponents whose strategies-even for women's suffrage-she repudiated. In private, she was generous, warm, and witty, close to friends, family, and her female partner. Howsam's account of uncovering Orme's professional and personal trajectory will appeal to academic and non-academic readers interested in the progress and setbacks women experienced in the late-Victorian and Edwardian decades."--Publisher's website.10aOrme, Eliza,d1848-1937. 0aWomen lawyerszGreat BritainvBiography. 0aWomen in politics. 0aWomenxSuffragezGreat BritaincHistory.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0392zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0392.jpgzConnect to cover image02932nam a2200397 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024501040028126400470038526400110043230000660044333600260050933700260053533800360056150000440059750600480064153800360068954001660072550400510089150504090094252009160135160000520226770000280231971000380234785600570238585600920244299101510758970896620250313114119.0m     o  d        cr  n         240321t20242024enka    sb    001 0beng d  z9781805112792 (hbk.)  z9781805112785 (pbk.)  a9781805112808q(pdf)  a9781805112839q(HTML)  a9781805112815q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1427749636  aStSaULbengerda00aByron and Trinityh[electronic resource] :bmemorials, marbles and ruins /cedited by Adrian Poole. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xii, 90 pages) :b12 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Bringing together diverse contributions from a series of scholars, three of them fellows of Trinity College, it explores various aspects of Byron's life and writing. The collection draws out the relationships between 'memorials, marbles and ruins', themes always prominent in his thinking and feeling. The earliest essay reprinted here dates from the bicentenary of Byron's birth in 1788. Thirty-six years and two centuries later, this collection honours a figure of enduring, complex significance, with whom Trinity College is proud to be associated. It will be of value to scholars and students of Byron, as well as those interested in his life, in the bi-centenary year of his death."--Publisher's website.10aByron, George Gordon Byron,cBaron,d1788-1824.1 aPoole, Adrian,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0399zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0399.jpgzConnect to cover image05776nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028124502800029326400470057326400110062030000680063133600260069933700260072533800360075150000440078750600480083153800360087954001670091550000690108250400530115150519170120452014780312160000350459960000460463465000500468065000500473065000330478065100430481365100430485670000280489970000390492770000480496670000450501471000380505985600570509785600920515499101517894970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         240402t20242024enka    sb    001 0beng d  z9781800649460 (hbk.)  z9781800649453 (pbk.)  a9781800649477q(pdf)  a9781800649514q(HTML)  a9781800649484q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1428180616  aStSaULbengerda  ae-gw---00aNo life without youh[electronic resource] :brefugee love letters from the 1930s : based on the correspondence of Ernst Moritz ("Mope") Felsenstein and Vera Hirsch Felsenstein, 1936-1939 /ccompiled and edited by Franklin Felsenstein ; with an introduction by Rachel Pistol. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xxii, 622 pages) :b88 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0). license.

Abridged in English from the original German, the correspondence and diaries have been expertly compiled and annotated by their only son who preserves his parents' love story in their own words. Their letters, written from Germany, England, Russia, and Palestine capture their desperate efforts to save themselves and their family, friends and businesses from the fascist tyranny. The book begins by contextualizing the early lives of Moritz and Vera. Because the letters are written to each other almost daily, they are incredibly immediate. Most centrally, the letters recount an astonishing love story, sensual in its intimate detail, and full of dramatic pathos in revealing the anxieties of being apart as the Nazi threat unfolds and broadens. It is told through the voices of two exceptionally articulate letter writers. This volume offers insights into the moral and psychological dilemmas faced by German Jews as a targeted community. It affords a unique appreciation of the impact of historical and socio-political upheavals on the lives of a persecuted minority. A scholarly introduction by Rachel Pistol draws out the main themes raised by this correspondence, observing its relevance to contemporary debates about migration and political authority."--Publisher's website.10aMoritz, ErnstvCorrespondence.10aFelsenstein, Vera HirschvCorrespondence. 0aJewszGermanyxHistoryy1918-1933vBiography. 0aJewszGermanyxHistoryy1933-1945vBiography. 0aJewszGermanyxPersecutions. 0aGermanyxSocial conditionsy1918-1933. 0aGermanyxSocial conditionsy1933-1945.1 aMoritz, Ernst,eauthor.1 aFelsenstein, Vera Hirsch,eauthor.1 aFelsenstein, Franklin,ecompiler,eeditor. 1 aPistol, Rachel,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0334zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0334.jpgzConnect to cover image08329nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024501290028126400470041026400110045730000770046833600260054533700260057133800360059750000440063350600480067753800360072554001780076150000690093950400530100850545520106152019340561365000380754765000610758570000330764670000290767971000380770885600570774685600920780399101518391970896620250313114122.0m     o  d        cr  n         240405t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800649842 (hbk.)  z9781800649835 (pbk.)  a9781800649859q(pdf)  a9781800649897q(HTML)  a9781800649866q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1428595620  aStSaULbengerda00aTranslating Russian literature in the global contexth[electronic resource] /cedited by Muireann Maguire and Cathy McAteer. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xii, 714 pages) :b11 colour illustrations, 2 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

This volume aims to provoke new debate about the continued currency of Russian literature as symbolic capital for international readers, in particular for nations seeking to create or consolidate cultural and political leverage in the so-called 'World Republic of Letters'. It also seeks to examine and contrast the mechanisms of the translation and uses of Russian literature across the globe. This collection presents academic essays, grouped according to geographical location, by thirty-seven international scholars. Collectively, their expertise encompasses the global reception of Russian literature in Europe, the Former Soviet Republics, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Their scholarship concentrates on two fundamental research areas: firstly, constructing a historical survey of the translation, publication, distribution and reception of Russian literature, or of one or more specific Russophone authors, in a given nation, language, or region; and secondly, outlining a socio-cultural microhistory of how a specific, highly influential local writer, genre, or literary group within the target culture has translated, transmitted, or adapted aspects of Russian literature in their own literary production. Each section is prefaced with a short essay by the co-editors, surveying the history of the reception of Russian literature in the given region. Considered as a whole, these chapters offer a wholly new overview of the extent and intercultural penetration of Russian and Soviet literary soft power during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This volume will open up Slavonic Translation Studies for the general reader, the student of Comparative Literature, and the academic scholar alike.

Minerals and metals - for batteries, circuit boards, wiring and other components - are essential to a digital, carbon-neutral economy. But how can we grapple with the environmental, social and geopolitical challenges caused by the extraction and use of these critical resources? Concise, accessible, and engaging, the essays in this timely collection intertwine a broad spectrum of disciplines to help us understand and reimagine our relationship with minerals. Exploring a wide range of themes, from the colonial history of mining and Indigenous resistance, to new frontiers in exploration geology, waste management and recycling, this book draws on experts from fields as diverse as geology, mining engineering, law, economics and public policy. The book also explores mineral resources through an artistic lens, with a collection of stunning images from the Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky, and excerpts of a new musical work, the Heavy Metal Suite. This thought-provoking and ultimately hopeful book guides us towards a more responsible, ethical and sustainable use of metals and minerals. It is essential reading for anyone interested in how we supply the resources needed for a carbon-neutral economic future."--Publisher's website. 0aMines and mineral resourcesxEnvironmental aspects. 0aMines and mineral resourcesxSocial aspects. 0aIndigenous peoplesxLand tenure. 0aMineral industriesxEnvironmental aspects. 0aMineral industriesxSocial aspects. 0aMineral industriesxTechnological innovations. 0aEnvironmental economics. 0aSustainable development.1 aTortell, Philippe Daniel,d1972-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0373zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0373.jpgzConnect to cover image04701nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024501180028126400470039926400110044630000770045733600260053433700260056033800360058650000440062250600480066653800360071454001780075050400510092850515070097952012380248665000230372465000370374765000530378465000370383765000500387465000480392465000410397270000310401371000380404485600570408285600920413999101521960970896620250313114119.0m     o  d        cr  n         240418t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112136 (hbk.)  z9781805112129 (pbk.)  a9781805112143q(pdf)  a9781805112174q(HTML)  a9781805112150q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1429614548  aStSaULbengerda00aTangible and intangible heritage in the age of globalisationh[electronic resource] /cedited by Lilia Makhloufi. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xxi, 236 pages) :b31 colour illustrations, 6 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

Offering a close and critical examination of heritage preservation in countries including Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chile, Egypt, Iran, Japan, Morocco, Oman, Syria and Tunisia, these essays illustrate the need to redefine heritage as an interdisciplinary and intercultural concept. They interrogate heritage paradigms while also providing concrete recommendations to promote the preservation of physical heritage spaces, and the cultural practices and social relationships that depend on them. Rich in detail and broad in relevance, this book emphasises specific cultural realities while also reflecting on the impact of global historical, social, economic and political trends to heritage conservation, scrutinising the conditions of the past to adapt them to the needs of the present and future. It will be of great relevance to all those interested in the preservation and management of heritage sites, including architects, urban planners, landscape architects, historians, sociologists and archaeologists, as well as heritage marketing, museum and cultural tourism professionals."--Publisher's website. 0aCultural property. 0aCultural propertyvCase studies. 0aCultural propertyxConservation and restoration. 0aIntangible propertyxProtection. 0aHistoric sitesxConservation and restoration. 0aArchitecturexConservation and restoration. 0aHistoric preservationvCase studies.1 aMakhloufi, Lilia,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0388zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0388.jpgzConnect to cover image04137nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025510000310027624500960030726400470040326400110045030000720046133600260053333700260055933800360058549000670062150000440068850600480073253800360078054001660081650000650098250000700104750000920111750400530120950503290126252015060159165000270309765000360312465000530316065000410321365100450325471000750329971000380337483000560341285600570346885600940352599101522108970896620250313114122.0m     o  d        cr  n         240419t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112525 (hbk.)  z9781805112518 (pbk.)  a9781805112532q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1430478772  aStSaULbengerda1 aGębski, Wiktor,eauthor.12aA grammar of the Jewish Arabic dialect of Gabesh[electronic resource]  /cWiktor Gębski. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xviii, 510 pages) :b6 illustrations, 68 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 23  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Belonging to the category of sedentary North African dialects, this variety is now spoken by a dwindling number of native speakers, primarily in Israel and France. Given the imminent extinction faced by many modern varieties of Judaeo-Arabic, including Jewish Gabes, the study's primary goal is to document and describe its linguistic nuances while reliable speakers are still accessible. Data for this comprehensive study were collected during fieldwork in Israel and France between December 2018 and March 2022. The volume's primary objective is a meticulous comparative analysis of Jewish Gabes, with a special emphasis on syntax, aiming to discern unique linguistic features through comparison with other North African dialects. The results of the study suggest that the Jewish dialect of Gabes emerged in the first wave of the Arab conquest of the Maghreb, thus exhibiting features that set it apart from its Muslim counterpart. This old variety therefore has the potential to provide invaluable information on the formation of Maghrebi Arabic and the mechanisms of language contact in the pre-Islamic Maghreb. The volume is organised in three main sections: phonology, morphology, and syntax, with the syntax section adopting historical and typological perspectives to shed light on this linguistic terra incognita."--Publisher's website.  0aJudeo-Arabic language. 0aJudeo-Arabic languagexGrammar. 0aJudeo-Arabic languagexDialectszAfrica, North.  0aEndangered languageszAfrica, North. 0aQābis (Tunisia : Province)xLanguages.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 23.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0394zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0394.jpgzConnect to cover image  06564nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300210028124501590030224600530046124600550051424600530056926400470062226400110066930000680068033600260074833700260077433800360080050000440083650600480088053800360092854001660096450001120113050400510124250527910129352014630408465000250554765000470557265000320561965100540565165100540570570000290575970000280578870000310581671000380584785600570588585600920594299101522857970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         240425t20242024enka    sb    001 0deng d  z9781805111863 (hbk.)  z9781805111856 (pbk.)  a9781805111870q(pdf)  a9781805111900q(HTML)  a9781805111887q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1431225527  aStSaULbengerda  aew-----aee-----03aAn archiveh[electronic resource] :bchildhood, memory, and the Cold War /cedited by Mnemo ZIN ; [Zsuzsa Millei, Iveta Silova, Nelli Piattoeva, editors].33aAnarchive :bchildhood, memory, and the Cold War34a(An)archive :bchildhood, memory, and the Cold War3 aAn archive :bchildhood memory, and the Cold War 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (viii, 420 pages) :b41 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

What can childhood memories tell us about state socialism and its aftermath? How can these intimate memories complicate history and redefine possible futures? These questions are at the heart of the (An)Archive: Childhood, Memory, and the Cold War. This edited collection stems from a collaboration between academics and artists who came together to collectively remember their own experiences of growing up on both sides of the 'Iron Curtain'. Looking beyond official historical archives, the book gathers memories that have been erased or forgotten, delegitimized or essentialized, or, at best, reinterpreted nostalgically within the dominant frameworks of the East-West divide. And it reassembles and (re)stores these childhood memories in a form of an 'anarchive': a site for merging, mixing, connecting, but also juxtaposing personal experiences, public memory, political rhetoric, places, times, and artifacts. These acts and arts of collective remembering tell about possible futures-and the past's futures-what life during the Cold War might have been but also what it has become. (An)Archive will be of particular interest to scholars in a variety of fields, but particularly to artists, educators, historians, social scientists, and others working with memory methodologies that range from collective biography to oral history, (auto)biography, autoethnography, and archives."--Publisher's website. 0aCold WarxBiography. 0aCold WarxSocial aspectszEuropexHistory. 0aSocialismzEurope, Eastern. 0aEurope, EasternxSocial conditionsy20th century. 0aEurope, WesternxSocial conditionsy20th century.1 aMillei, Zsuzsa,eeditor.1 aSilova, Iveta,eeditor.1 aPiattoeva, Nelli,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0383zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0383.jpgzConnect to cover image03023nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016103500220018604000210020810000310022924501090026025000210036926400470039026400110043730000770044833600260052533700260055133800360057750000440061350600480065753800360070554001760074150400570091750504090097452009280138365000220231165000170233365000320235070000320238271000380241485600570245285600920250999101522894970896620250606161111.0m     o  d        cr##n#########240426t20242024enkad   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805113096 (hbk.)  z9781805113089 (pbk.)  a9781805113102q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1431223605  aStSaULbengerda1 aRichter, Michael,eauthor.10aNo prices no games!h[electronic resource] :bfour economic models /cMichael Richter, Ariel Rubinstein.  a[First edition]. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xxi, 236 pages) :b13 colour illustrations, 7 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

These four conventions are analysed using simple and mathematically straightforward models, without any pretensions regarding direct applied usefulness. While we do not advocate for the adoption of any of these conventions specifically - we do advocate that when modelling an economic situation, alternative equilibrium notions should be considered, rather than automatically reaching for the familiar approaches of prices or games."--Publisher's website. 0aEconomics models. 0aGame theory. 0aPricesxEconometric models.1 aRubinstein, Ariel,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0404zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0404.jpgzConnect to cover image04844nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028124501400029326400470043326400110048030000800049133600260057133700260059733800360062350000440065950600480070353800360075154001660078750002130095350400670116650516060123352012010283965000290404065000330406970000270410270000330412970000370416271000380419985600570423785600920429499101522929970896620250313114125.0m     o  d        cr  n         240426t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648159 (hbk.)  z9781800648142 (pbk.)  a9781800648166q(pdf)  a9781800648203q(HTML)  a9781800648173q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1432460782  aStSaULbengerda  aev-----04aThe Nordic minueth[electronic resource] :broyal fashion and peasant tradition /cedited by Petri Hoppu, Egil Bakka, and Anne Fiskvik. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (viii, 578 pages) :b221 colour illustrations, 20 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

One of the most significant dances in Europe, with a strong symbolic significance in western dance culture and dance scholarship, the minuet has evolved a distinctive pathway in this region, which these rigorous and pioneering essays explore. As well as situating the minaret in different national and cultural contexts, this collection marshals a vast number of sources, including images and films, to analyze the changes in the dance across time and among different classes. Following the development of the minuet into dance revival and historical dance movements of the twentieth century, this rich compendium draws together a distinguished group of scholars to stimulate fresh evaluations and new perspectives on the minuet in history and practice. The Nordic Minuet: Royal Fashion and Peasant Tradition is essential reading for researchers, students and practitioners of dance; musicologists; and historical and folk dancers; it will be of interest to anybody who wants to learn more about this vibrant dance tradition."--Publisher's website. 0aMinuet (Dance)xHistory. 0aDancezScandinaviaxHistory.1 aHoppu, Petri,eeditor.1 aBakka, Egil,d1943-eeditor.1 aFiskvik, Anne Margrete,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0314zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0314.jpgzConnect to cover image03659nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026904300120029010000380030224501260034026400470046626400110051330000580052433600260058233700260060833800360063450000440067050600480071453800360076254001650079850001890096350400430115250506000119552010370179565000440283265000360287665000340291270000680294671000380301485600570305285600920310999101535565970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         150129t20142014enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781909254558 (Hardback)  z9781909254541 (Paperback)  a9781909254565q(pdf)  a9781909254572q(epub)  a9781909254589q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)900407883   aStSaULbengerda  ae-no---1 aKyllingstad, Jon Røyne,eauthor.10aMeasuring the master raceh[electronic resource] :bphysical anthropology in Norway, 1890-1945 /cJon Røyne Kyllingstad. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (xxii, 248 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

But it was also a commonly accepted idea in the early twentieth century, and an actual scientific concept originating from anthropological research on the physical characteristics of Europeans. The Scandinavian Peninsula was considered to be the historical cradle and the core area of this 'master race'.    This book investigates the role played by Scandinavian scholars in inventing this so-called superior race, and discusses how this concept put its stamp on Norwegian physical anthropology, prehistory, national identity, and on the Norwegian eugenics movement. It also explores the decline and scientific disputation of these ideas in the 1930s as they came to be associated with the 'genetic cleansing' of Nazi Germany. This is the first comprehensive study on Norwegian physical anthropology, and its findings shed new light on current political and scientific debates about race across the globe."--Publisher's website. 0aPhysical anthropologyzNorwayxHistory. 0aAnthropometryzNorwayxHistory. 0aCraniometryzNorwayxHistory.12aKyllingstad, Jon Røyne.tKortskaller og langskaller.lEnglish.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0051zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0051.jpgzConnect to cover image05797nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026924501250029026400470041526400110046230000990047333600260057233700260059833800360062450000440066050600480070453800360075254002120078850400530100050527590105352011770381261000530498965000380504265000260508065000350510670000350514171000380517685600570521485600920527199101545517970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         150217t20152015enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783740635 (Hardback)  z9781783740628 (Paperback)  a9781783740642q(pdf)  a9781783740659q(epub)  a9781783740666q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)904562444   aStSaULbengerda00aFrom dust to digitalh[electronic resource] :bten years of the Endangered Archives Programme /cedited by Maja Kominko. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (lxviii, 654 pages) :bcolour illustrations, colour facsimiles, colour maps.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work as a whole is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial Non-derivative 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Many of these archives preserve information that may cast new light on historical phenomena and lead to their reinterpretation. But such rich collections are often at risk of being lost before the history they capture is recorded. This volume celebrates the tenth anniversary of the Endangered Archives Programme at the British Library, established to document and publish online formerly inaccessible and neglected archives from across the globe. From Dust to Digital showcases the historical significance of the collections identified, catalogued and digitised through the Programme, bringing together articles on 19 of the 244 projects supported since its inception. These contributions demonstrate the range of materials documented - including rock inscriptions, manuscripts, archival records, newspapers, photographs and sound archives - and the wide geographical scope of the Programme. Many of the documents are published here for the first time, illustrating the potential these collections have to further our understanding of history."--Publisher's website.20aBritish Library.bEndangered Archives Programme. 0aArchival materialsxDigitization. 0aDigital preservation. 0aCultural propertyxProtection.1 aKominko, Maja,d1978-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0052zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0052.jpgzConnect to cover image04123nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000370019502000410023202000260027303500220029904000210032104300120034210000270035424500930038126400470047426400110052130000390053233600260057133700260059733800360062350000440065950600480070353800360075154001650078750400570095250508940100952014480190365000680335165000830341971000380350285600570354085600920359799101558891970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         150406t20152015enk     sbf   000 0 eng d  z9781783741083 (Hardback)  z9781783741076 (Paperback)  a9781783741090q(pdf)  a9781783741106q(epub reflowable)  a9781783741106q(epub fixed layout)    a9781783741113q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)908831899   aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk---1 aBrooks, Greg,eauthor.10aDictionary of the British English spelling systemh[electronic resource] /cGreg Brooks. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (xxx, 492 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

It's a reference work intended for anyone interested in the English language, especially those who teach it, whatever the age or mother tongue of their students. It will be particularly useful to those wishing to produce well-designed materials for teaching initial literacy via phonics, for teaching English as a foreign or second language, and for teacher training. English spelling is notoriously complicated and difficult to learn; it is correctly described as much less regular and predictable than any other alphabetic orthography. However, there is more regularity in the English spelling system than is generally appreciated. This book provides, for the first time, a thorough account of the whole complex system. It does so by describing how phonemes relate to graphemes and vice versa. It enables searches for particular words, so that one can easily find, not the meanings or pronunciations of words, but the other words with which those with unusual phoneme-grapheme/grapheme-phoneme correspondences keep company. Other unique features of this book include teacher-friendly lists of correspondences and various regularities not described by previous authorities, for example the strong tendency for the letter-name vowel phonemes (the names of the letters <a, e, i, o, u>) to be spelt with those single letters in non-final syllables."--Publisher's website. 0aEnglish languagexOrthography and spellingvHandbooks, manuals. 0aEnglish languagezGreat BritainzOrthography and spellingvHandbooks, manuals.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0053zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0053.jpgzConnect to cover image03566nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000280019502000260022303500220024904000210027110000330029224500850032526400470041026400110045730000620046833600260053033700260055633800360058250000440061850600480066253800360071054001650074650400670091150503630097852015500134165000220289165000250291365000190293871000380295785600570299585600920305299101564348970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         150422t20152015enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783741236 (Hardback)  z9781783741229 (Paperback)  a9781783741243q(pdf)  a9781783741250q(epub)    a9781783741267q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)908833490   aStSaULbengerda1 aTeich, Mikuláš,eauthor.14aThe scientific revolution revisitedh[electronic resource] /cMikuláš Teich. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (x, 146 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Drawing on a lifetime of scholarly experience in six penetrating chapters, Teich examines the ways of investigating and understanding nature that matured during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, charting their progress towards science as we now know it and insisting on the essential interpenetration of such inquiry with its changing social environment. The Scientific Revolution was marked by the global expansion of trade by European powers and by interstate rivalries for a stake in the developing world market, in which advanced medieval China, remarkably, did not participate. It is in the wake of these happenings, in Teich's original retelling, that the Thirty Years War and the Scientific Revolution emerge as products of and factors in an uneven transition in European and world history: from natural philosophy to modern science, feudalism to capitalism, the late medieval to the early modern period.     With a narrative that moves from pre-classical thought to the European institutionalisation of science - and a scope that embraces figures both lionised and neglected, such as Nicole Oresme, Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, Thaddeus Hagecius, Johann Joachim Becher - The Scientific Revolution Revisited illuminates the social and intellectual sea changes that shaped the modern world."--Publisher's website. 0aSciencexHistory. 0aTechnologyxHistory. 0aWorld history.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0054zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0054.jpgzConnect to cover image04128nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000280019502000260022303500220024904000210027110000310029224501660032326400470048926400110053630000690054733600260061633700260064233800360066850000440070450600480074853800360079654001650083250400510099750512830104852010020233165000370333365000240337065000330339470000330342771000380346073000350349885600570353385600920359099101565814970896620250313114126.0m        d        cr  n         150427t20152015enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783741182 (Hardback)  z9781783741175 (Paperback)  a9781783741199q(pdf)  a9781783741205q(epub)    a9781783741212q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)908833808   aStSaULbengerda1 aBotting, Jack H.,eauthor.10aAnimals and medicineh[electronic resource] :bthe contribution of animal experiments to the control of disease /cJack H.

Laboratory animals have been essential to this progress, and the knowledge gained has saved countless lives-both human and animal. Unfortunately, those opposed to using animals in research have often employed doctored evidence to suggest that the practice has impeded medical progress. This volume presents the articles Jack Botting wrote for the Research Defence Society News from 1991 to 1996, papers which provided scientists with the information needed to rebut such claims. Collected, they can now reach a wider readership interested in understanding the part of animal experiments in the history of medicine-from the discovery of key vaccines to the advancement of research on a range of diseases, among them hypertension, kidney failure and cancer."--Publisher's website. 0aAnimal experimentationxHistory. 0aLaboratory animals. 0aMedicinexResearchxHistory.1 aBotting, Regina M.,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.0 aResearch Defence Society News.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0055zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0055.jpgzConnect to cover image04154nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000350028124500950031626400470041126400110045830000790046933600260054833700260057433800360060050000440063650600480068053800360072854001660076450000660093050400670099650510140106352011680207760000180324560000320326360000230329560000410331860000380335965000190339765100260341665100310344271000380347385600570351185600920356899101571991970896620250313114120.0m     o  d        cr  n         240514t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783749577 (hbk.)  z9781800648180 (pbk.)  a9781805110019q(pdf)  a9781800643079q(HTML)  a9781800643055q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1432557271  aStSaULbengerda1 aClossey, Luke,d1975-eauthor.10aJesus and the making of the modern mind, 1380-1520h[electronic resource] /cLuke Clossey. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xiv, 786 pages) :b131 colour illustrations, 13 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

This sweeping and unconventional investigation looks at Jesus across one hundred forty years of social, cultural, and intellectual history. Mystics married him, Renaissance artists painted him in three dimensions, Muslim poets praised his life-giving breath, and Christopher ("Christ-bearing") Columbus brought the symbol of his cross to the Americas. Beyond the European periphery, this global study follows Jesus across - and sometimes between - religious boundaries, from Greenland to Kongo to China. Amidst this diversity, Jesus and the Making of the Modern Mind, 1380-1520 offers readers sympathetic and immersive insight into the religious realities of its subjects. To this end, this book identifies two perspectives: one uncovers hidden meanings and unexpected connections, while the other restricts Jesus to the space and time of human history. Minds that believed in Jesus, and those that opposed him, made use of both perspectives to make sense of their worlds. This book includes over one hundred images, tables and audio clips."--Publisher's website.00aJesus Christ.00aJesus ChristxAppreciation.00aJesus ChristxArt.00aJesus ChristxDevotional literature.00aJesus ChristxPerson and offices. 0aArt, Medieval. 0aEuropexCivilization. 0aEuropexIntellectual life.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0371zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0371.jpgzConnect to cover image04962nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000280019502000260022303500210024904000210027024501690029126400470046026400110050730000660051833600260058433700260061033800360063650000440067250600480071653800360076454001650080050400530096550400510101850518580106952011200292760000270404765000280407465000290410265000260413170000320415770000370418970000290422670000380425571000380429385600570433185600920438899101573956970896620250313114123.0m        d        cr  n         150512t20152015enkac   sb    011 0 eng d  z9781783741489 (Hardback)  z9781783741472 (Paperback)  a9781783741496q(pdf)  a9781783741502q(epub)    a9781783741519q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)972039628  aStSaULbengerda00aEssays in conveyancing and property lawh[electronic resource] :bin honour of Professor Robert Rennie /cedited by Frankie McCarthy, James Chalmers, Stephen Bogle. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (x, 412 pages) :billustrations, portraits.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

This volume celebrates his retirement from the Chair of Conveyancing at the University of Glasgow in 2014 with a selection of essays written by his peers and colleagues from the judiciary, academia and legal practice. Each chapter covers a topic of particular interest to Professor Rennie during his career, from the historical development of property law rules through to the latest developments in conveyancing practice and the evolution of the rules of professional negligence. Although primarily Scottish in focus, the contributions will have much of interest to lawyers in any jurisdiction struggling with similar practical problems, particularly those with similar legal roots including the Netherlands and South Africa.  As a whole, the collection is highly recommended to students, practitioners and academics."--Publisher's website. 10aRennie, Robert,d1947- 0aConveyancingzScotland. 0aReal propertyzScotland. 0aNegligencezScotland.1 aMcCarthy, Frankie,eeditor.1 aChalmers, James,d1976-eeditor.1 aBogle, Stephen,eeditor.1 aRennie, Robert,d1947-ehonoress.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0056zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0056.jpgzConnect to cover image03779nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026904300120029010000300030224501110033226400470044326400110049030000620050133600260056333700260058933800360061550000440065150600480069553800360074354001650077950400860094450502550103052014620128560000310274760000910277865000380286965000500290765000450295765000570300265100510305971000380311085600570314885600920320599101579067970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         150529t20152015enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783741281 (Hardback)  z9781783741274 (Paperback)  a9781783741298q(pdf)  a9781783741304q(epub)  a9781783741311q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)1151510132  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk-st1 aGossman, Lionel,eauthor.10aThomas Annan of Glasgowh[electronic resource] :bpioneer of the documentary photograph /cLionel Gossman. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (x, 182 pages) :bcolour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

The Old Closes and Streets of Glasgow, Thomas Annan's photographic record of this central section of the city prior to its demolition in accordance with the City of Glasgow Improvements Act of 1866, is widely recognized as a classic of nineteenth-century documentary photography. Annan's achievement as a photographer of paintings, portraits and landscapes is less widely known. Thomas Annan of Glasgow: Pioneer of the Documentary Photograph offers a handy, comprehensive and copiously illustrated overview of the full range of the photographer's work. The book opens with a brief account of the immediate context of Annan's career as a photographer: the astonishing florescence of photography in Victorian Scotland. Successive chapters deal with each of the main fields of his activity, touching along the way on issues such as the nineteenth-century debate over the status of photography - a mechanical practice or an artistic one? - and the still ongoing controversies surrounding the documentary photograph in particular. While the text itself is intended for the general reader, extensive endnotes amplify particular themes and offer guidance to readers interested in pursuing them further."--Publisher's website.14aAnnan, Thomas,d1829-1887.10aAnnan, Thomas,d1829-1887.tPhotographs of old closes, streets, &c., taken 1868-1877.  0aPhotographerszScotlandxHistory. 0aStreetszScotlandzGlasgowxPictorial works.  0aPhotographyzScotlandzGlasgowxHistory. 0aDocumentary photographyzScotlandzGlasgowxHistory. 0aGlasgow (Scotland)xHistoryxPictorial works. 2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0057zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0057.jpgzConnect to cover image03863nam a2200553 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031304100130033404300100034710000460035724000560040324501730045926400470063226400110067930000570069033600260074733700260077333800360079949000470083550000440088250600480092653800360097454001650101050400430117550501590121852012870137754600320266460000740269660000630277065000650283365000550289870000400295370000860299371000380307983000430311785600570316085600920321799101581922970896620250313114125.0m        d        cr  n         150612t20152015enkc    sb    000 d eng d  z9781783740437 (Hardback)  z9781783740420 (Paperback)  a9781783740444q(pdf)  a9781783740451q(epub)  a9781783740468q(mobi)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)913570904  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghger  ae-it-1 aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805,eauthor.10aVerschwörung des Fiesco zu Genua.lEnglish.f201510aFiesco's conspiracy at Genoah[electronic resource] /cby Friedrich Schiller ; translated by Flora Kimmich ; with an introduction and notes to the text by John Guthrie. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (xviii, 132 pages) :b2 portraits.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen Book classics,x2054-2178 ;vvol.

A Republican Tragedy. At the head of the conspiracy stood Gian Luigi de' Fieschi (1524-1547), Schiller's Count Fiesco, a clever, courageous and charismatic figure, an epicurean and unhesitant egoist, politically ambitious, but unsure of his aims and principles. He is one of Schiller's mysterious, protean characters who secures both our admiration and disgust. With Fiesco as tragic hero Schiller examines the complex entanglement of morality and politics in his own times that was to preoccupy him throughout his career. The play was a moderate success when performed in Mannheim in 1784; it was more popular in Berlin where, during Schiller's lifetime, it was performed many times in a version by Carl Plümicke, which however radically altered the play's meaning. There have been some noteworthy productions on the German stage and television, even if it has remained somewhat in the shadow of Schiller' other works. In the English-speaking world it is all but unknown and very seldom performed. This translation aims to remedy that oversight."--Publisher's website.  aTranslated from the German.10aSchiller, Friedrich,d1759-1805.tVerschwörung des Fiesco zu Genua.10aFieschi, Gian Luigi,cconte di Lavagna,d1522-1547vDrama. 0aGerman drama (Tragedy)y18th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aGerman drama (Tragedy)vTranslations into English.1 aKimmich, Flora,d1939-etranslator.1 aGuthrie, John,d1953-ewriter of introduction,ewriter of supplementary material.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen Book classics ;vv. 2.x2054-217840uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0058zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0058.jpgzConnect to cover image04163nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026804300120028924501620030126400470046326400110051030000830052133600260060433700260063033800360065650000440069250600480073653800360078454001650082050400790098550508530106452013460191765000340326365000610329765000300335865000260338865100340341470000340344870000240348271000380350685600570354485600920360199101586856970896620250313114119.0m        d        cr  n         150713t20152015enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783741137 (Hardback)  z9781783741120 (Paperback)  a9781783741144q(pdf)  a9781783741151q(epub)  a9781783741168q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)915725025  aStSaULbengerda  aae-----00aComplexity, security and civil society in East Asiah[electronic resource] :bforeign policies and the Korean peninsula /cedited by Peter Hayes and Kiho Yi. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (xiii pages, 1 unnumbered page, 451 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Detailed case studies of China, North and South Korea, and Japan demonstrate the importance of civil society and 'civic diplomacy' in reaching shared solutions to these problems in East Asia and beyond. Each chapter describes regional civil society initiatives that tackle complex challenges to East Asia's security. In doing so, the book identifies key pressure points at which civil society can push for constructive changes¯especially ones that reduce the North Korean threat to its neighbors. Unusually, this book is both theoretical and practical. Complexity, Security and Civil Society in East Asia presents strategies that can be led by civil society and negotiated by its diplomats to realize peace, security, and sustainability worldwide. It shows that networked civic diplomacy offers solutions to these urgent issues that official 'complex diplomacy' cannot. By providing a new theoretical framework based on empirical observation, this volume is a must read for diplomats, scholars, students, journalists, activists, and individual readers seeking insight into how to solve the crucial issues of our time."--Publisher's website. 0aNational securityzEast Asia. 0aNational securityzEast AsiaxInternational cooperation. 0aCivil societyzEast Asia. 0aDiplomacyzEast Asia. 0aEast AsiaxForeign relations.1 aHayes, Peter,d1953-eeditor.1 aYi, Ki-ho,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0059zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0059.jpgzConnect to cover image06278nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031324501490033426400470048326400110053030000590054133600260060033700260062633800360065249000650068850000440075350600480079753800360084554001650088150528090104652011240385565000310497965000430501065000500505365000260510365000380512965000450516765000320521265000440524465000510528870000370533970000290537670000300540570000320543571000380546783000580550585600570556385600920562099101588142970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         150724t20152015enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781783741588 (Hardback)  z9781783741571 (Paperback)  a9781783741595q(pdf)  a9781783741601q(epub)  a9781783741618q(mobi)  z2059-4232 (Print)  a2059-4240 (Online)  a(OCoLC)915725026  aStSaULbengerda00aWhat works in conservationh[electronic resource].n2015 /cedited by William J.

Does helping migrating toads across roads increase populations? How do you reduce predation on bird populations? What Works in Conservation has been created to provide practitioners with answers to these and many other questions about practical conservation. This book provides an assessment of the effectiveness of 648 conservation interventions based on summarized scientific evidence relevant to the practical global conservation of amphibians, reducing the risk of predation for birds, conservation of European farmland biodiversity and some aspects of enhancing natural pest control and soil fertility. It contains key results from the summarized evidence for each conservation intervention and an assessment of the effectiveness of each by international expert panels.

In it, Dorottya Fabian explores the contributions and limitations of some of these approaches to performance, be they theoretical, cultural, historical, perceptual, or analytical. Through a detailed investigation of recent recordings of J. S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin, she demonstrates that music performance functions as a complex dynamical system. Only by crossing disciplinary boundaries, therefore, can we put the aural experience into words. A Musicology of Performance provides a model for such a method by adopting Deleuzian concepts and various empirical and interdisciplinary procedures. Fabian provides a case study in the repertoire, while presenting new insights into the state of baroque performance practice at the turn of the twenty-first century. Through its wealth of audio examples, tables, and graphs, the book offers both a sensory and a scholarly account of musical performance. These interactive elements map the connections between historically informed and mainstream performance styles, considering them in relation to broader cultural trends, violin schools, and individual artistic trajectories. A Musicology of Performance is a must read for academics and post-graduate students and an essential reference point for the study of music performance, the early music movement, and Bach's opus."--Publisher's website.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Each vertical reading analyses three same-numbered cantos from the three canticles: Inferno i, Purgatorio i and Paradiso i; Inferno ii, Purgatorio ii and Paradiso ii; etc. Although scholars have suggested before that there are correspondences between same-numbered cantos that beg to be explored, this is the first time that the approach has been pursued in a systematic fashion across the poem. This collection - to be issued in three volumes - offers an unprecedented repertoire of vertical readings for the whole poem. As the first volume exemplifies, vertical reading not only articulates unexamined connections between the three canticles but also unlocks engaging new ways to enter into core concerns of the poem. The three volumes thereby provide an indispensable resource for scholars, students and enthusiasts of Dante. The volume has its origin in a series of thirty-three public lectures held in Trinity College, the University of Cambridge (2012-2016) which can be accessed at the "Cambridge Vertical Readings in Dante's Comedy" website."--Publisher's website.00aDante Alighieri,d1265-1321.tDivina commediaxCriticism and interpretation.00aDante Alighieri,d1265-1321.tDivina commediaxCriticism, Textual.1 aCorbett, George,eeditor.1 aWebb, Heather,d1976-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0066zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0066.jpgzConnect to cover image04601nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500210024704000210026824500840028926400470037326400110042030000720043133600260050333700260052933800360055550000440059150600480063553800360068354001650071950400530088450510050093752016790194260000680362160000490368960000660373865000650380465000580386970000410392771000380396885600570400685600920406399101599512970896620250313114122.0m        d        cr  n         150921t20152015enkab   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783740987 (Hardback)  z9781783740970 (Paperback)  a9781783740994q(pdf)  a9781783741007q(epub)  a9781783741014q(mobi)  a(OCoLC)922167213  aStSaULbengerda00aMr Emerson's revolutionh[electronic resource] /cedited by Jean McClure Mudge. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (490 pages) :billustrations (some colour), maps.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

A broad and deep, yet cautious revolutionary, he spoke about a spectrum of inner and outer realities-personal, philosophical, theological and cultural-all of which gave his mid-career turn to political and social issues their immediate and lasting power.  This multi-authored study frankly explores Emerson's private prejudices against blacks and women while he also publicly championed their causes. Such a juxtaposition freshly charts the evolution of Emerson's slow but steady application of his early neo-idealism to emancipating blacks and freeing women from social bondage. His shift from philosopher to active reformer had lasting effects not only in America but also abroad. In the U.S. Emerson influenced such diverse figures as Thoreau, Whitman, Dickinson and William James, and in Europe, Mickiewicz, Wilde, Kipling, Nietzsche, and Camus, as well as many leading followers in India and Japan. The book includes over 170 illustrations, among them eight custom-made maps of Emerson's haunts and wide-ranging lecture itineraries as well as a new four-part chronology of his life placed alongside both national and international events as well as major inventions. Mr. Emerson's Revolution provides essential reading for students and teachers of American intellectual history, the abolitionist and women's rights movement-and for anyone interested in the nineteenth-century roots of these seismic social changes."--Publisher's website. 10aEmerson, Ralph Waldo,d1803-1882xCriticism and interpretation.10aEmerson, Ralph Waldo,d1803-1882xInfluence.10aEmerson, Ralph Waldo,d1803-1882xPolitical and social views. 0aAntislavery movementszUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century. 0aWomen's rightszUnited StatesxHistoryy19th century.1 aMudge, Jean McClure,d1933-eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0065zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0065.jpgzConnect to cover image05433nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000240016102000250018502000250021003500210023504000210025624501610027726400470043826400110048530000650049633600260056133700260058733800360061350000440064950600480069353800360074154001770077750400530095450520420100752013850304965000520443465000450448665000520453165000400458365100450462365100340466870000320470270000420473471000380477685600570481485600920487199101601646970896620250313114120.0m        d        cr  n         150921t20152015enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781783741038 (hbk.)  z9781783741021 (pbk.)  a9781783741045 (pdf)  a9781783741052 (epub)  a9781783741069 (mobi)  a(OCoLC)923571546  aStSaULbengerda00aTellings and textsh[electronic resource] :bmusic, literature and performance in North India /cedited by Francesca Orisini and Katherine Butler Schofield. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (566 pages) :billustrations (some colour)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThe text in this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

The contributions from some of the best scholars in the field cover a wide range of literary genres and social and cultural contexts across the region. The texts and practices are contextualized in relation to the broader social and political background in which they emerged, showing how religious affiliations, caste dynamics and political concerns played a role in shaping social identities as well as aesthetic sensibilities. By doing so this book sheds light into theoretical issues of more general significance, such as textual versus oral norms; the features of oral performance and improvisation; the role of the text in performance; the aesthetics and social dimension of performance; the significance of space in performance history and important considerations on repertoires of story-telling. The book also contains links to audio files of some of the works discussed in the text. Tellings and Texts is essential reading for anyone with an interest in South Asian culture and, more generally, in the theory and practice of oral literature, performance and story-telling."--Publisher's website.  0aTransmission of textszSoutheast AsiaxHistory. 0aOral traditionzSoutheast AsiaxHistory. 0aLiteraturezSoutheast AsiaxCriticism, Textual. 0aMusicxPerformancezSoutheast Asia. 0aSoutheast AsiaxSocial life and customs. 0aSoutheast AsiaxCivilization.1 aOrsini, Francesca,eeditor.1 aSchofield, Katherine Butler,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0062zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0062.jpgzConnect to cover image05252nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500210029204000210031304100130033410000290034724501360037624600210051226400470053326400110058030000820059133600260067333700260069933800360072549000540076150000440081550600480085953800360090754001650094354001910110850400640129950508800136352018080224354600760405160000220412760000560414960000780420560000330428365000290431670000330434570000660437871000380444483000550448285600570453785600920459499101602922970896620250313114121.0m        d        cr  n         151012t20152015enkab   sbq   000 0 eng d  z9781783741335 (Hardback)  z9781783741328 (Paperback)  a9781783741342q(pdf)  a9781783741359q(epub)  a9781783741366q(mobi)  z2059-5743 (Print)  a2059-5751 (Online)  a(OCoLC)926274368  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghlat1 aMulligan, Bret,eauthor.10aCornelius Nepos, Life of Hannibalh[electronic resource] :bLatin text, notes, maps, illustrations and vocabulary /cBret Mulligan.  aLife of Hannibal 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (174 pages) :billustrations (chiefly colour), colour maps.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aDickinson College commentariesx2059-5743vvol. 1  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Trasimene. Cannae. With three stunning victories, Hannibal humbled Rome and nearly shattered its empire. Even today Hannibal's brilliant, if ultimately unsuccessful, campaign against Rome during the Second Punic War (218-202 BC) make him one of history's most celebrated military leaders. This biography by Cornelius Nepos (c. 100-27 BC) sketches Hannibal's life from the time he began traveling with his father's army as a young boy, through his sixteen-year invasion of Italy and his tumultuous political career in Carthage, to his perilous exile and eventual suicide in the East. As Rome completed its bloody transition from dysfunctional republic to stable monarchy, Nepos labored to complete an innovative and influential collection of concise biographies. Putting aside the detailed, chronological accounts of military campaigns and political machinations that characterized most writing about history, Nepos surveyed Roman and Greek history for distinguished men who excelled in a range of prestigious occupations. In the exploits and achievements of these illustrious men, Nepos hoped that his readers would find models for the honorable conduct of their own lives. Although most of Nepos' works have been lost, we are fortunate to have his biography of Hannibal. Nepos offers a surprisingly balanced portrayal of a man that most Roman authors vilified as the most monstrous foe that Rome had ever faced. Nepos' straightforward style and his preference for common vocabulary make Life of Hannibal accessible for those who are just beginning to read continuous Latin prose, while the historical interest of the subject make it compelling for readers of every ability. This book contain embedded audio files of the original text read aloud by Christopher Francese."--Publisher's website.   aText in Latin; introductory material, notes and translation in English.10aNepos, Cornelius.10aNepos, Cornelius.tHannibalxHistory and criticism.10aNepos, Cornelius.tVitae excellentium imperatorumxHistory and criticism.00aHannibal,d247 B.C.-182 B.C. 0aLatin languagexReaders.12aNepos, Cornelius.tHannibal.12aNepos, Cornelius.tVitae excellentium imperatorum.tPrologus.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aDickinson College commentaries ;vv. 1.x2059-574340uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0068zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0068.jpgzConnect to cover image03988nam a2200577 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200240018602200230021003500220023304000210025504100130027604300210028910000420031024501760035226400470052826400110057530000710058633600260065733700260068333800360070949000670074550000440081250600480085653800360090454001660094050000700110650000920117650400530126854600550132150506190137652008100199565000410280565100290284665100290287565100340290470000380293870000320297670000360300870000460304471000750309071000380316583000560320385600570325985600940331699101607476970896620250313114126.0m     o  d        cr  n         240514t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112310 (hbk.)  z9781805112303 (pbk.)  a9781805112327q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)    z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1433109042  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghara  af-ua---af-sj---1 aKhan, Geoffrey,eauthor,etranslator.10aArabic documents from medieval Nubiah[electronic resource]  /cGeoffrey Khan ; in consultation with Grzegorz Ochała, Pamela Rose, Robin Seignobos and Naïm Vanthieghem. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xiv, 840 pages) :b174 illustrations, 5 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 24  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

The edition of the documents is accompanied by English translations and a detailed analysis of their contents and historical background. The documents throw new light on relations between Egypt and Nubia in the High Middle Ages, especially in the Fatimid period. They are of particular importance since previous historical studies from the perspective of Arabic sources have been almost entirely based on historiographical sources, often written a long time after the events described and distorted by tendentious points of view."--Publisher's website.  0aManuscripts, ArabiczEgyptzIbrīm. 0aNubiaxRelationszEgypt. 0aEgyptxRelationszNubia. 0aIbrīm (Egypt)vAntiquities.1 aOchała, Grzegorz,econtributor. 1 aRose, Pamela,econtributor.1 aSeignobos, Robin,econtributor.1 aVanthieghem, Naïm,d1986-econtributor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 24.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0391zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0391.jpgzConnect to cover image  04320nam a2200409 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000400028124501290032126400470045026400110049730000400050833600260054833700260057433800360060050000440063650600480068053800360072854001660076450400530093050514540098352011900243760000430362765000530367071000380372385600570376185600920381899101608409970896620250313114123.0m     o  d        cr  n         240521t20242024enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112402 (hbk.)  z9781805112396 (pbk.)  a9781805112419q(pdf)  a9781805112440q(HTML)  a9781805112426q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1433109251  aStSaULbengerda1 aDesmond, Adrian J.,d1947-eauthor.10aReign of the beasth[electronic resource] :bthe atheist world of W.

Reign of the Beast pieces together the extraordinary story of this lost working-man's institution and its enigmatic owner, the wine merchant W. D. Saull. A financial backer of the anti-clerical Richard Carlile, the 'Devil's Chaplain' Robert Taylor, and socialist Robert Owen, Saull outraged polite society by putting humanity's ape ancestry on display. He weaponized his museum fossils and empowered artisans with a knowledge of deep geological time that undermined the Creationist base of the Anglican state. His geology museum, called the biggest in Britain, housed over 20,000 fossils, including famous dinosaurs. Saull was indicted for blasphemy and reviled during his lifetime. After his death in 1855, his museum was demolished and he was expunged from the collective memory. Now multi-award-winning author Adrian Desmond undertakes a thorough reading of Home Office spy reports and subversive street prints to re-establish Saull's pivotal place at the intersection of the history of geology, atheism, socialism, and working-class radicalism."--Publisher's website.10aSaull, William Devonshire,d1783-1855. 0aMuseumszEnglandzLondonxHistoryy19th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0393zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0393.jpgzConnect to cover image05872nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024502210028126400470050226400110054930000720056033600260063233700260065833800360068450000440072050600480076453800360081254001830084850002650103150400510129650520120134752015440335965000240490365000340492765000340496165000270499565000320502270000340505470000350508870000310512370000370515471000380519185600570522985600920528699101611244970896620250313114119.0m     o  d        cr  n         240603t20242024enkad   sb    001 0deng d  z9781805112730 (hbk.)  z9781805112723 (pbk.)  a9781805112747q(pdf)  a9781805112778q(HTML)  a9781805112754q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1436684859  aStSaULbengerda00aTeaching music performance in higher educationh[electronic resource] :bexploring the potential of artistic research /cedited by Helen Julia Minors, Stefan Östersjö, Gilvano Dalagna, and Jorge Salgado Correia.  1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (viii, 332 pages) :b34 illustrations, 11 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC  BY-NC 4.0) license.

Since the nineteenth century, the master-apprentice pedagogical model has dominated, creating a learning environment that emphasises the development of technical skills rather than critical and creative faculties. This book contributes to the renewal of this field by being the first to address the potential of artistic research in developing student-centred approaches and greater student autonomy. This potential is demonstrated in chapters illustrating artistic research projects that are embedded within higher music education courses across Europe, with examples ranging from instrumental tuition and ensemble work to the development of professional employability skills and inclusive practices. Bringing together diverse and experienced voices working within Higher Music Education but often also as professional performers, this edited collection pairs critical reflection with artistic insight to present new approaches to curricula for teaching interpretation and performance. It calls for greater collaboration between Higher Education and professional music institutions to create closer bonds with music industries and, thereby, improve students' career opportunities. Teaching Music Performance in Higher Education will appeal to scholars, performers, teachers, but also students whose interests centre on innovative practices in conservatoires and music departments."--Publisher's website. 0aMusicxPerformance. 0aMusicxPerformancexResearch. 0aMusicxInstruction and study. 0aMusiciansxEmployment. 0aMusicxVocational guidance.1 aMinors, Helen Julia,eeditor.1 aÖstersjö, Stefan,eeditor.1 aDalagna, Gilvano,eeditor.1 aSalgado Correia, Jorge,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0398zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0398.jpgzConnect to cover image03863nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028110000290029324501140032226400470043626400110048330000580049433600260055233700260057833800360060450000440064050600480068453800360073254001990076850400530096750508140102052013410183465000410317565000380321671000380325485600570329285600920334999101611253970896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr  n         240603t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781800648395 (hbk.)  z9781800642522 (pbk.)  a9781800643840q(pdf)  a9781800649279q(HTML)  a9781800647053q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1436679507  aStSaULbengerda  aa-ja---1 aMehl, Margaret,eauthor.10aMusic and the making of  modern Japanh[electronic resource] :bjoining the global concert /cMargaret Mehl.  1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xvi, 456 pages) :b1 illustration.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

The country's rise to a major player on the stage of Western music has been equally spectacular. The connection between these two developments, however, has never been explored. How did making music make Japan modern? How did Japan make music that originated in Europe its own? And what happened to Japan's traditional music in the process? Music and the Making of Modern Japan answers these questions. Discussing musical modernization in the context of globalization and nation-building, Margaret Mehl argues that, far from being a side-show, music was part of the action on centre stage. Making music became an important vehicle for empowering the people of Japan to join in the shaping of the modern world. In only fifty years, from the 1870s to the early 1920s, Japanese people laid the foundations for the country's post-war rise as a musical as well as an economic power. Meanwhile, new types of popular song, fuelled by the growing global record industry, successfully blended inspiration from the West with musical characteristics perceived as Japanese. Music and the Making of Modern Japan represents a fresh contribution to historical research on making music as a major cultural, social, and political force."--Publisher's website. 0aMusiczJapanxHistory and criticism. 0aMusiczJapanxWestern influences.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0374zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0374.jpgzConnect to cover image04483nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100130027410000530028724501830034026400470052326400110057030000690058133600260065033700260067633800360070249000670073850000440080550600480084953800360089754001660093350000700109950000920116950400550126154600400131650506480135652015440200463000660354865000570361471000750367171000380374683000560378485600570384085600920389799101611332970896620250825121125.0m     o  d        cr##n#########240604t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111504 (hbk.)  z9781805111498 (pbk.)  a9781805111511q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1437948335  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghheb1 aHøjgaard, Christian Canu,eauthor,etranslator.10aRoles and relations in biblical lawh[electronic resource] :ba study of participant tracking, semantic roles, and social networks in Leviticus 17-26 /cChristian Canu Højgaard. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (x, 452 pages) :b34 illustrations, 16 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 25  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Conclusion: The Social Network of Leviticus 17-26 / Christian Canu Højgaard.  a"Leviticus 17-26, an ancient law text known as the Holiness Code, prescribes how particular persons are to behave in concrete, everyday situations. The addressees of the law text must revere their parents, respect the elderly, fear God, take care of their fellow, provide for the sojourner, and so on. The sojourner has his own obligations, as do the priests. Even God is said to behave in various ways towards various persons. Thus, the law text forms an intricate web of persons and interactions. There is a growing awareness that ancient law texts were not arbitrary collections of legal paragraphs but articulations of certain world views. The laws were rational in their own respect and were based on the lawgiver's ethos. However, since the ethical values of the lawgiver rarely-if ever-surface in the text itself, it has proven difficult to grasp with traditional, exegetical methods. This study offers a novel approach to mapping out the ethos of an ancient law text like Leviticus 17-26. By employing social network analysis, the participants and their interactions are mapped to scrutinize the ethical roles embodied by the persons of the law. To accomplish this, the study undertakes meticulous research into both the participants and the interactions of Leviticus 17-26. The book investigates a semi-automatic approach to extracting participant information from a text and offers new methods for analysing Hebrew interactions (realised as verbal predicates) in terms of dynamicity, causation, and agency."--Publisher's website.00aBible.pLeviticus, XVII-XXVIxCriticism, interpretation, etc. 0aInterpersonal relationsxReligious aspectsxJudaism.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 25.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0376zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0376.jpgzConnect to cover image03425nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500210023804000210025910000310028024501340031124600560044524600430050126400470054426400110059130000570060233600260065933700260068533800360071150000440074750600480079153800360083954001670087550401300104250505220117252010050169460000520269970000530275171000380280485600570284285600920289999101611467970896620250313114123.0m     o  d        cr  n         240606t20242024enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805111429 (hbk.)  z9781805111412 (pbk.)  a9781805111436q(pdf)  a9781805111474q(HTML)  a9781805111443q(epub)  a(OCoLC)645149985  aStSaULbengerda0 aSaki,d1870-1916,eauthor.10aOriginal and uncollected storiesh[electronic resource] /cSaki (H.

A trove of annotations and carefully sourced bibliographical information illuminates the Edwardian context behind the thirteen selected stories, of which three ('Mrs. Pendercoet's Lost Identity', 'The Romance of Business' and 'The Optimist') were only recently rediscovered.

This edited volume provides a much-needed, interdisciplinary introduction to the field and highlights cutting-edge research for interested readers and researchers in demography, the evolutionary behavioural sciences, biology, and related disciplines. By bridging the boundaries between social and biological sciences, the volume stresses the importance of a unified understanding of both in order to grasp past and current demographic patterns. Demographic traits, and traits related to demographic outcomes, including fertility and mortality rates, marriage, parental care, menopause, and cooperative behavior are subject to evolutionary processes. Bringing an understanding of evolution into demography therefore incorporates valuable insights into this field; just as knowledge of demography is key to understanding evolutionary processes. By asking questions about old patterns from a new perspective, the volume-composed of contributions from established and early-career academics-demonstrates that a combination of social science research and evolutionary theory offers holistic understandings and approaches that benefit both fields. Human Evolutionary Demography introduces an emerging field in an accessible style. It is suitable for graduate courses in demography, as well as upper-level undergraduates. Its range of research is sure to be of interest to academics working on demographic topics (anthropologists, sociologists, demographers), natural scientists working on evolutionary processes, and disciplines which cross-cut natural and social science, such as evolutionary psychology, human behavioral ecology, cultural evolution, and evolutionary medicine. As an accessible introduction, it should interest readers whether or not they are currently familiar with human evolutionary demography."--Publisher's website. 0aHuman evolution. 0aNatural selection. 0aDemography. 0aHuman geography.1 aBurger, Oskar,eeditor.1 aLee, Ronald Demos,d1941-eeditor.1 aSear, Rebecca,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0251zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0251.jpgzConnect to cover image06370nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024501320028126400470041326400110046030000690047133600260054033700260056633800360059250000440062850600480067253800360072054001820075650000650093850400530100350515680105650503630262452024080298765000220539565000260541765000410544370000330548471000380551774002080555585600570576385600920582099101708127070896620250313114123.0m     o  d        cr##n#########250110t20252025enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114055 (hbk.)  z9781805114048 (pbk.)  a9781805114062q(pdf)  a9781805114086q(HTML)  a9781805114079q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1483748831  aStSaULbengerda00aBeing in shadow and lighth[electronic resource] :bacademics in post/conflict higher education /cedited by Dina Zoe Belluigi. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xx, 352 pages) :b18 illustrations, 3 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

When attention is given, the focus tends to be on student activism, access to higher education, or curriculum development. The experiences of academics affected by conflict remain under-researched, despite the crucial role they play as educators and in generating, documenting, preserving and challenging knowledges. This is particularly concerning given that academics have−and continue to be−at risk as targets of sanction, persecution and oppression. This edited volume seeks to address this gap by exploring, and evoking, the complexities of academic subjectivity, place and practice in contexts where intellectual and state authority are contested or in transition. It features contributions by academics, artists and memory activists who have stepped bravely outside of the parameters of their disciplines, with modes of enquiry and representation that include conversations, vignettes and case studies, critical ethnographies, oral life histories, interviews, poetry and collage. Within the ten chapters are consideration of conflicts within Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, England, Mexico, Nigeria, Northern Ireland, Palestine, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Syria and Venezuela. Being in Shadow and Light encourages a deeper understanding of academics' navigation of these difficult conditions. The authors' insider-outsider positioning brings forth the richness of ways through dilemmas−of omission, trauma, displacement, inheritance, injustice, distortion, desire. Grounding the many social, cultural, economic, and epistemic politics within academia, troubles the enclosure of 'conflict' in politics at the grand level, as if only within the realm of interest for state and international actors. Against sanitising the uncertainties and particularities of being an academic figure, the authors reflect on the states and sites of conflict as spaces which shape living. This work is a call to recognize, document and study the often-overlooked subjectivities and contributions of academics thinking and practicing within societies undergoing conflict(s) and in their aftermath. As such, it will be of interest to academics, students and staff working within universities, as well audiences interested in intellectuals and institutions in contexts undergoing change."--Publisher's website. 0aAcademic freedom. 0aTeaching, Freedom of. 0aCollege teachersxPolitical aspects.1 aBelluigi, Dina Zoe,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.3 aLa verdad y las reparaciones :una conversación sobre la participación del sector de la educación superior en la Comisión para el Esclarecimiento de la Verdad, la Convivencia y la No Repetición.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0427zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0427.jpgzConnect to cover image03592nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800420007002000250011202000250013702000250016202000260018702000260021303500220023904000210026104300120028210000280029424501040032226400470042626400110047330000690048433600260055333700260057933800360060550000440064150600480068553800360073354001820076950400530095150505070100452012900151161000730280165000480287465000490292271000380297185600570300985600920306699101708936840896620250620095129.0m     o  d        cr##n#########250109t20242024enka    ssb b  010 0 eng d  z9781805114208 (hbk.)  z9781805114192 (pbk.)  a9781805114215q(pdf)  a9781805114239q(HTML)  a9781805114222q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1482161652  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk---1 aSmith, Justin,eauthor.14aThe birds that wouldn't singh[electronic resource] :bremembering the D-Day Wrens /cJustin Smith. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xxii, 540 pages) :b117 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Drawing on public and private archives, it reveals the untold stories of the women serving in the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), balancing their wartime contributions with the strictures of secrecy and censorship. The narrative is framed by letters from these Wrens, which provide intimate glimpses into both the personal and professional challenges they faced during World War II. The book captures the atmosphere of war as experienced by British auxiliaries. It highlights the Wrens' vital but often overlooked role in the D-Day planning effort and beyond, revealing the surreal coexistence of the ordinary and extraordinary in wartime. Focusing in particular on the wartime archive of one of the Wrens, Joan Prior, the author brings to life the contribution of these women to the war effort, while also offering insights into British, French, and German morale and culture. This thoughtful and moving account adds depth to the broader historical narrative of World War II, making it a valuable addition for both the general reader and the professional historian."--Publisher's website.10aGreat Britain.bRoyal Navy.bWomen's Royal Naval Service (1939-1993) 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xWomenzGreat Britain. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xParticipation, Female.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0430zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0430.jpgzConnect to cover image05126nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024501150028126400470039626400110044330000700045433600260052433700260055033800360057650000440061250600480065653800360070454001820074050400510092250522440097352011860321765000250440365000350442865000240446370000300448771000380451785600570455585600920461299101708936860896620250313114121.0m     o  d        cr##n#########250109t20242024enkad   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805114000 (hbk.)  z97818051-3997 (pbk.)  a9781805114017q(pdf)  a9781805114031q(HTML)  a9781805114024q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1479770541  aStSaULbengerda00aGenetic narratologyh[electronic resource] :banalysing narrative across versions /cedited by Dirk van Hulle. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xiv, 306 pages) :b12 illustrations, 2 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

By examining the creative process behind literary works through drafts, manuscripts and revisions, this book reveals how narratives are shaped in real time. Through diverse case studies-from Charlotte Brontë to Stephen King-this collection demonstrates how the material processes of writing influence narrative structure, pacing, and even the 'untold'. By integrating genetic criticism with narratological methods, contributors explore how stories evolve, providing fresh insights into time, space, character, and suspense. Bridging the gap between the production and reception of texts, this volume makes a compelling case for incorporating genetic methods into broader narratological frameworks, enhancing not only our understanding of the genesis of literary works, ultimately enriching the reading experience, but also our awareness of the ways we narrativise this genesis. The book will be of interest to students and researchers alike, offering a new set of tools for analysing narrative across different versions. 0aNarration (Rhetoric) 0aDiscourse analysis, Narrative. 0aCriticism, Textual.1 aHulle, Dirk van,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0426zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0426.jpgzConnect to cover image04652nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000240017002000260019402000260022003500220024604000210026824501690028924600440045824600390050226400460054126400110058730000710059833600260066933700260069533800360072150000440075750600480080153800360084954001820088550400410106750513860110852013960249465000290389065000320391970000340395170000340398571000380401985600570405785600920411499101708936880896620250313114119.0m        d        cr##n#########240109t20242024enkad   sb    000 0deng d  z9781805114390 (Hardback)  z9781805114383 (Paperback)  a978805114406q(pdf)  a9781805114420q(HTML)  a9781805114413q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1478292248  aStSaULbengerda00aInvesting in the structural transformationh[electronic resource] :b2024 European public investment outlook /cedited by Floriana Cerniglia and Francesco Saraceno.30a2024 European public investment outlook30aEuropean public investment outlook 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2024. 4c©2024  a1 online resource (xii, 198 pages) :b44 illustrations, 10 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Reflecting on the lessons from the 2008-2020 polycrisis and recent economic challenges, this timely book examines fiscal policy's role in both stabilization and long-term economic development. Part I, 'State of the Art', reviews current public investment and industrial policies in major European economies, including France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. It provides detailed analyses of each country's approach to fostering structural transformation through public investment. Part II, 'Challenges', addresses the diverse obstacles and opportunities facing Europe's industrial policy. It emphasizes a multidimensional strategy to overcome bottlenecks in key sectors and drive transformation. Topics include the role of industrial policy in the green transition, creating a cohesive strategy for Europe, enhancing economic security, trends in European Union defence spending, sustainable mobility, and financing structural investment beyond 2027. This volume is essential reading for researchers, economists, and policymakers focused on understanding and implementing effective public policy in Europe, and will further appeal to anyone interested in EU governance and public investment strategies more broadly."--Publisher's website. 0aFinance, PubliczEurope. 0aPublic investmentszEurope.1 aCerniglia, Floriana,eeditor.1 aSaraceno, Francesco,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0434zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0434.jpgzConnect to cover image05339nam a2200493 u 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800420007002000290011202000300014102000250017102000260019602000260022202200230024802200240027104000210029524501630031626400460047926400110052530000760053633600260061233700260063833800360066449000700070050000440077050600480081453800360086254001910089850400510108950516990114052015410283965000330438065000300441365000260444365000340446970000270450370000310453070000290456171000380459083000680462885600570469685600920475399101708936920896620250313114122.0m     o  d        cr##n#########250109t20242024enkad   sb    001 0 eng d   z9781805113225 (Hardback)  z9781805113218 (Paperback)  a9781805113232q(pdf)  a9781805113256q(HTML)  a9781805113249q(epub)  a2755-2616q(Print)  a2755-2624q(Online)  aStSaULbengerda00aBreaking imagesh[electronic resource] :biconoclastic analyses of mathematics and its education /cedited by Brian Greer, David Kollosche, and Ole Skovsmose. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2024. 4c©2024  a1 online resource (vi, 594 pages) :b11 colour illustrations, 4 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aStudies on mathematics education and societyx2755-2624 ;vvol. 2  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0).

This rich collection begins from that premise to explore the various social influences, institutional forces and lived realities that shape and mould the study and practice of mathematics, and are moulded by it in turn.These twenty-one essays explore questions of mathematics as a topic of philosophy, but also the nature and purpose of mathematics education and the role of mathematics in moulding citizens. It challenges the biases and prejudices inherent within uninformed histories of mathematics, including problems of white supremacy, the denial of cultural difference and the global homogenization of teaching methods. In particular, the book contrasts the effectiveness of mathematics and science in modelling physical phenomena and solving technical problems with its ineffectiveness in modelling social phenomena and solving human problems, and urges us to consider how mathematics might better meet the urgent crises of our age.The book addresses anybody who is interested in reflecting on the role of mathematics in society from different perspectives. It allows mathematicians to ponder about the cultural connections of mathematics and provides new perspectives for philosophical, sociological and cultural studies of mathematics. Because of the book's emphasis on education in mathematics, it is especially interesting for mathematics teachers and teacher educators to challenge their understanding of the subject."--Publisher's website. 0aMathematicsxSocial aspects. 0aMathetmaticsxPhilosophy. 0aMathematicsxHistory. 0aMathematics and civilization.1 aGreer, Brian,eeditor.1 aKollosche, David,eeditor.1 aSkovsmose, Ole,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aStudies on mathematics education and societyx2755-2624;vv. 2.4 uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0407zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0407.jpgzConnect to cover image03690nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000420028124501420032326400470046526400110051230000570052333600260058033700260060633800360063250000440066850600480071253800360076054001820079650000650097850400530104350504940109652014340159060000180302465000390304271000380308185600570311985600920317699101715311700896620250313114121.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250128t20252025enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114789 (hbk.)  z9781805114772 (pbk.)  a9781805114796q(pdf)  a9781805114819q(HTML)  a9781805114802q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1492407272  aStSaULbengerda1 aStanchina, Gabriella,d1972-eauthor.14aThe art of becoming infiniteh[electronic resource] :bMou Zongsan's vertical rethinking of self and subjectivity /cGabriella Stanchina. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (vi, 362 pages) :b1 illustration.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

This work delves into the philosopher's exploration of self and subjectivity, setting Mou Zongsan's theories against Western paradigms. Mou contrasts Western 'horizontal' model, based on the separation of subject and object, and aimed at cognitive enhancement, with the 'vertical' view dominant in the Confucian and Daoist tradition. The vertical model has, at its core, a practical-performative interpretation of the subject, based on the moral self-cultivation. This spiritual cultivation enables the finite human being to 'become infinite,' embodying the original unlimited moral mind that constitutes the Self and the universe. In addressing fundamental questions of self-consciousness and self-identity, the book contextualizes Mou's philosophy within contemporary discussions in neuroscience and cognitive science. By placing Mou's ideas in dialogue with Western thought-examining thinkers like Husserl, Kant, Hegel, and Lévinas-as well as with Daoist and Confucian vision of mind, this work opens a pathway to understanding selfhood beyond purely epistemological boundaries. This book will be of interest to readers and scholars interested in the contemporary debate about mind and the Self, as well as those intrigued by the new horizons opened by a cross-cultural Western-Chinese approach to subjectivity."--Publisher's website.10aMou, Zongsan. 0aPhilosophy, Chinesey20th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0442zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0442.jpgzConnect to cover image03898nam a2200397 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016103500220018604000210020810000350022924501570026426400470042126400110046830000720047933600260055133700260057733800360060350000440063950600480068353800360073154001620076750000650092950400430099450511260103752010820216363000270324570000410327271000380331385600570335185600920340899101715322100896620250313114119.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250127t20252025enkad   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781800649385 (hbk.)  z9781800649378 (pbk.)  a9781800649392q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1484882227  aStSaULbengerda1 aNavarro, Danielle J.,eauthor.10aLearning statistics with jamovih[electronic resource] :ba tutorial for beginners in statistical analysis /cDanielle J.

Zammit. It celebrates his extensive contributions to the fields of Semitic Studies, Arabic linguistics, and comparative Semitic philology. Spanning decades of dedicated research and teaching, Professor Zammit's career has been marked by a profound engagement with the Arabic language and its diverse dialects, as well as its historical and cultural intersections with Maltese and Syriac. The volume features a carefully curated collection of essays authored by distinguished scholars, reflecting the breadth and depth of Professor Zammit's academic interests. Topics range from Arabic dialectology and phonetics to linguistic contact phenomena and the grammaticalisation processes in Semitic languages. Contributions explore the linguistic heritage of Central Asia, the Judeo-Arabic traditions of Libya and Syria, and the influences of Arabic on Maltese toponymy and idiomatic expressions. Together, these studies exemplify the rich interdisciplinarity and intellectual rigour that characterise Professor Zammit's work. This Festschrift not only honours Professor Zammit's enduring scholarly impact but also serves as a vital resource for linguists, philologists, and researchers in the fields of Arabic and Semitic studies. It stands as a testament to his dedication to fostering academic inquiry and dialogue, inspiring both colleagues and students alike. This volume ensures that his scholarly contributions will continue to influence and inform the field for years to come."--Publisher's website.10aZammit, Martin R. 0aArabic languagexDialects. 0aArabic languagexPhilology.1 aZammit, Martin R.,ehonoree.1 aFrendo, Anthony,eeditor.1 aTal, Abraham,eauthor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 31.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0445zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0445.jpgzConnect to cover image03982nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100130027410000310028724501520031826400470047026400110051730000430052833600260057133700260059733800360062349000670065950000440072650600480077053800360081854001820085450000700103650000920110650000220119854600320122050506150125252011890186763000350305665000400309170000270313171000750315871000380323383000560327185600570332785600920338499101717066570896620250313114119.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250207t20242024enkd    s     001 0 eng d  z9781805113546 (hbk.)  z9781805113539 (pbk.)  a9781805113553q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1493369172  aStSaULbengerda1 aengaheb1 aFlorentin, Moshe,eauthor.14aThe Samaritan Pentateuchh[electronic resource] :ban English translation with a parallel annotated Hebrew text /cMoshe Florentin and Abraham Tal. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2024] 4c©2024  a1 online resource (2, xiv, 1108 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 30  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

One of the most ancient and important Samaritan manuscripts of the Pentateuch, MS Nablus 6, copied in 1204 CE, serves to represent the Samaritan version.The English translation is placed in the left-hand column of each page, while the Samaritan original is displayed in the right-hand column. For the reader's convenience, differences between the Samaritan and Masoretic versions are marked in red. In addition to translating the Hebrew text and highlighting the differences between it and the Masoretic text, each difference is explained in a brief note in an apparatus at the bottom of the page. Where expansion is appropriate, the reader is referred to extended notes at the end of the edition."--Publisher's website.00aBible.pPentateuchlSamaritan. 0aSamaritan Hebrew languagexGrammar.1 aTal, Abraham,eauthor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 30.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0415zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0415.jpgzConnect to cover image06095nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024501540028126400470043526400110048230000710049333600260056433700260059033800360061650000440065250600480069653800360074454001990078050000650097950400510104450531460109552010950424165000380533665000340537470000320540870000340544071000380547485600570551285600920556999101717066580896620250313114125.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250207t20252025enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805112556 (hbk.)  z9781805112549 (pbk.)  a9781805112563q(pdf)  a9781805112594q(HTML)  a9781805112570q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1493375436  aStSaULbengerda 4aNavigating our way to solutions in marine conservationh[electronic resource]  /cedited by Larry B.

This book is a collection of research on the relationships between people, their environment, their expertise and their languages along the ecologically fragile coasts of the Arabian Peninsula. These studies are the outcome of many years of collaborative fieldwork with local communities in three main regions of southern and eastern Arabia: the Musandam Peninsula, Dhofar and al-Mahrah, and the island of Soqotra. Bringing together oral literature, traditional scientific knowledge, and marine subsistence at the peripheries of the Arabian seaboard, the volume makes a major contribution to the documentation of the indigenous Modern South Arabian languages (MSAL), regional Arabic, and the Kumzari language, as well as to a greater understanding of their speakers' mastery in harvesting the seas. Diverse contributions by scholars and language community members explore the songs and stories, experiences and viewpoints of indigenous fishers, and shed light on the cultural significance of the maritime species encountered by each community. This book is a testimony to resilient ways of life, many of which have vanished, but which at the same time may offer unique answers for the future of humanity."--Publisher's website. 0aFisherszArabian Peninsula. 0aArabsxFolklore. 0aArabic languagexDialectszArabian Peninsula. 0aPersian languagexDialectsxKumzari. 0aFishingzArabian PeninsulaxTerminology.1 aWatson, Janet C.

This volume redresses this gap by putting the discipline of world literature into dialogue with scholarship on orature and folklore. It asks, what does world literature look like if we start from orature, from oral texts and utterances, and from the performances and audiences that support it? Featuring contributions from an international array of scholars, Oral Literary Worlds explores oral traditions from three multilingual regions: the Maghreb, East Africa and South Asia. Essays discuss a variety of vernacular genres, from Swahili tumbuizo to Na'o folk songs, shedding light on less studied forms of vernacular oral production. Collectively, the contributions critique the characterisation of oral traditions as static and pre-modern, and underscore the contemporary relevance of orature to cultural and political discourse. Oral Literary Worlds offers a timely and accessible perspective on world literature through the lens of orature, moving away from traditional hierarchies and dichotomies that have characterised previous scholarship. It aims to open up new ways of thinking through local and transnational textual circulation, literary power dynamics, the interaction between textuality and audiences, and aesthetic philosophies.

Phenomenography focuses on the relationship between meaning-people's holistic understanding of phenomena-and structure, that is the part-whole structure of people's awareness of phenomena. This structure of awareness then forms the basis for identifying differences in the experienced meaning of phenomena, and how awareness needs to change to allow new meanings to emerge-whether educationally, historically, culturally or socially. Over its 50-year history, there have been substantial advancements in the methods and theoretical assumptions underlying phenomenographic research, but these developments are not always recognised. This book details how the 21st-century practice of phenomenography differs from its earlier iterations, emphasising that earlier works can be misleading when used to justify current research practices. Phenomenography is a developing, not static, approach to social science research, and this book introduces further methodological and theoretical extensions to the research. Although most commonly used in educational research, the potential of phenomenography to contribute to research in other social science disciplines is increasingly being recognised and is further emphasised in this book. In this way, this book is not only essential reading for doctoral students, but will also be of interest to those already experienced in phenomenography, and to social science researchers within and outside the field of education."--Publisher's website. 0aPhenomenology. 0aKnowledge, Theory of. 0aSocial sciencesxResearchxMethodology.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0431zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0431.jpgzConnect to cover image04063nam a2200541 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100130027410000280028724501140031526400470042926400110047630000680048733600260055533700260058133800360060749000670064350000440071050600480075453800360080254001660083850000700100450000920107450000820116650000580124850400670130654600240137350504220139752012150181965000430303465000260307765000560310365000440315971000750320371000380327883000560331685600570337285600920342999101717547620896620250313114119.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250207t20252025enkag   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113928 (hbk.)  z9781805113911 (pbk.)  a9781805113935q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1499402355  aStSaULbengerda1 aengaara1 aHaydar, Adnan,eauthor.10aNew words to old tunesh[electronic resource] :bgenres and metrics of Lebanese Zajal poetry /cAdnan Haydar. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (2, xvii, 206 pages) :billustrations, music.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 33  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

It presents a novel framework for the proper scansion of meters and emphasises the previously overlooked roles of musical and poetic stress. It details nearly twenty zajal genres, including popular songs that use zajal metrics, and integrates musical notations and web-streamed audio links to enrich the reader's experience. By presenting both theoretical analysis and practical applications, the book not only contributes to the academic study of Lebanese and Arab oral traditions but also supports broader efforts to preserve and disseminate this cultural heritage through digital humanities. While previous works have been largely descriptive or focused on specific poets, this book provides a detailed analytical approach to zajal metrics and their musical dimensions. This rigorous and comprehensive study will be of interest to scholars working on oral traditions, folklore studies, ethnomusicology, cultural studies, oral-formulaic poetry traditions, throughout the Middle East and beyond."--Publisher's website. 0aZajalzLebanonxHistory and criticism. 0aFolk poetryzLebanon. 0aFolk songs, ArabiczLebanonxHistory and criticism. 0aOral interpretation of poetryzLebanon.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 33.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0424zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0424.jpgzConnect to cover image04134nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100130027410000280028724501510031526400470046626400110051330000750052433600260059933700260062533800360065149000670068750000440075450600480079853800360084654001660088250000700104850000920111850400690121054600250127950501920130452017140149663000370321065000410324765000220328871000750331071000380338583000560342385600570347985600920353699101719220300896620250313114119.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250220t20252025enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805115410 (hbk.)  z9781805115403 (pbk.)  a9781805115427q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1502102401  aStSaULbengerda1 aengaarc1 aPhillips, Kim,eauthor.10aTwo early Byzantine Bible manuscripts in Christian Palestinian Aramaich[electronic resource] :bCodex Climaci Rescriptus II & XI /cKim Phillips. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (2, viii, 214 pages) :b18 illustrations, 13 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 34  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Textual and Linguistic Commentary / Kim Phillips.  a"Despite the ubiquitous use of Greek by the Christian church of the late antique Southern Levant, many Christians in the region also-or only-spoke Aramaic. Today, this dialect, known as Christian Palestinian Aramaic (CPA), is relatively sparsely attested in the form of regional inscriptions and, particularly, in the form of vernacular translations of Greek biblical, liturgical and theological texts. These translations survive predominantly as undertexts within palimpsest manuscripts. Codex Climaci Rescriptus (CCR) is one of the most important palimpsest manuscript sources for the recovery of CPA texts. CCR was created around the tenth century; its superior text consists of Syriac translations of two theological works by John Climacus. This tenth century manuscript was manufactured using recycled parchment from at least eleven older, obsolete manuscripts whose texts had been scraped off in preparation for reuse. Two of these eleven manuscripts form the focus of the present study. The first-CCR II-was originally a manuscript of the Pauline Epistles in CPA translation; the second-CCR XI-was originally an Apostolos manuscript (i.e., it contained the Acts of the Apostles and the Catholic Epistles). Cutting-edge multispectral imaging technology has been brought to bear on CCR in the last decade, enabling more detailed and accurate reconstructions of its various undertexts. With the benefit of this technology, this study offers a detailed codicological introduction to each of CCR II and CCR XI, fresh editions of the undertexts themselves, as well as a commentary that begins to evaluate the ongoing significance of this manuscript for biblical and linguistic studies."--Publisher's website.00aBible.pNew Testament.lAramaic.  aSyriac language, PalestinianvTexts. 0aAramaic language.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 34.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0455zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0455.jpgzConnect to cover image08057nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202200220023802200230026004000210028324501560030426400470046026400110050730000710051833600260058933700260061533800360064149001140067750000440079150600480083553800360088354001840091950000650110350400510116850543070121952015760552665000510710265000440715365000340719765000280723170000350725970000300729471000380732483000520736285600570741485600920747199101719229650896620250313114119.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250227t20252025enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113676 (hbk.)  z9781805113669 (pbk.)  a9781805113683q(pdf)  a9781805113706q(HTML)  a9781805113690q(EPUB)  z3049-7469 (Print)  z3049-7477 (Online)  aStSaULbengerda04aThe field guide to mixing social and biophysical methods in environmental researchh[electronic resource] /cedited by Rebecca Lave and Stuart N.

Our environment is increasingly a product of interacting biophysical and social forces, shaped by climate change, colonial legacies, gender norms, hydrological processes, and more. Understanding these intricate interactions requires a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative, biophysical and social research. However, mixed-methods environmental research remains rare, hindered by academic boundaries, limited training, and the challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration. Time, funding, and the integration of diverse data further complicate this research, whilst the dynamics and ethics of interdisciplinary teams add another layer of complexity. Despite these challenges, mixed-methods research offers a more robust and ultimately transformative understanding of environmental questions. This Field Guide aims to inspire and equip researchers to undertake such studies. Organized like a recipe book, it assists researchers in the preparation of their field work, as well as offering entry points to key methods and providing examples of successful mixed-methods projects. This book will be of interest to scholars wishing to tackle environmental research in a more holistic manner, spanning 'sister' disciplines such as anthropology, statistics, political science, public health, archaeology, geography, history, ecology, and Earth science."--Publisher's website. 0aEnvironmental sciencesxResearchxMethodology. 0aEnvironmental sciencesxSocial aspects. 0aPhysical geographyxResearch. 0aMixed methods research.1 aLave, Rebecca,d1970-eeditor.1 aLane, Stuart N.,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aCritical physical geography ;vv. 1.x3049-747740uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0418zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0418.jpgzConnect to cover image04248nam a2200589 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100130027424503140028724600390060126400470064026400110068730000440069833600260074233700260076833800360079450000440083050600480087453800360092254001820095850000700114050002430121050400510145354600240150452014930152860000200302165000210304165000220306265000230308465000240310770000300313170000330316170000270319470000340322170000310325570000360328670000370332271000380335974000560339783000560345385600570350985600920356699101722948550896620250606162056.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250314t20252025enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805115779 (hbk.)  z9781805115762 (pbk.)  a9781805115786q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1506476236  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaheb00aInterconnected traditions :bSemitic languages, literatures, and cultures : a Festschrift for Geoffrey Khan.nVolume 1,pHebrew and the wider Semitic worldh[electronic resource] /cedited by Aaron D.

This Festschrift, celebrating a distinguished career that culminated in his tenure (2012-2025) as Regius Professor of Hebrew in the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Cambridge, brings together contributions from a vast and representative array of scholars-retired, established, and up and coming-whose work has been influenced by his vast intellectual legacy. Reflecting the interconnected traditions that Khan has illuminated throughout his career, this volume presents cutting-edge research on Hebrew and Aramaic linguistics, historical syntax, manuscript studies, and the transmission of textual traditions across centuries and cultures. Contributors engage with topics central to Khan's scholarship, including the evolution of the Biblical Hebrew verbal system, the intricacies of Masoretic notation, Geniza discoveries, Samaritan and medieval Judaeo-Arabic texts, and computational approaches to linguistic analysis. As Khan retires from his role as Regius Professor, this collection stands as both a tribute and a continuation of his work, honouring his lifelong dedication to understanding and preserving the linguistic and literary heritage of the Semitic world."--Publisher's website.10aKhan, Geoffrey. 0aHebrew language. 0aAramaic language. 0aSemitic languages. 0aSemitic literature.1 aKhan, Geoffrey,ehonoree.1 aHornkohl, Aaron D.,eeditor.1 aVidro, Nadia,eeditor.1 aWatson, Janet C.

Therapists endeavour to be non-judgemental and, indeed, are no more qualified to pass judgement on others than anyone else; do they nevertheless learn anything about ethics from their disciplined listening? The same question was asked after the war about the persecution of the Jews and other minorities, and it's a very live issue again, faced as we are by movements like ISIS, or Putinism in Russia, that cause great suffering in the name of religious or moral regeneration - a bewildering paradox that David Astor, former editor of The Observer called 'the scourge'. Can psychotherapy throw any light on it, or contribute any ideas as to how we might contain, if not prevent, the barbarism it sanctions? Can it offer any insights into a different, more inclusive kind of ethics, and if so, can we glean any guidance from it as to how we might further it? These are the questions the author explores, drawing on psychoanalytic thinking on these issues for over a century and illustrated by his work with individuals over four decades."--Publisher's website. 0aPsychotherapy. 0aPsychotherapyxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aCulture conflictxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aEthnic conflictxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aConscience.1 aWilliams, Rowan,d1950-ewriter of foreword.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0416zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0416.jpgzConnect to cover image03531nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000430028124500990032426400470042326400110047030000600048133600260054133700260056733800360059350000440062950600480067353800360072154001820075750000650093950400530100450503890105752014020144665000240284865000130287265000250288571000380291085600570294885600920300599101722948570896620250606161418.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250314t20252025enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114963 (hbk.)  z9781805114956 (pbk.)  a9781805114970q(pdf)  a9781805114994q(HTML)  a9781805114987q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1503962568  aStSaULbengerda1 aSeshasayee, Aswin Sai Narain,eauthor.10aBacterial genomes :btrees and networksh[electronic resource] /cAswin Sai Narain Seshasayee. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xvi, 238 pages) :b38 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

But their story is far more complex. Bacteria thrive in diverse and extreme environments, driven by the dynamic evolution of their genomes. These tiny organisms wield an extraordinary ability to adapt, balancing genetic changes across generations with rapid physiological responses to environmental shifts. In Bacterial Genomes, the evolutionary and regulatory processes that shape bacterial life are brought to life. This textbook offers a conceptual exploration of how bacterial genomes are organized, how they evolve, and how their genetic information is interpreted through intricate molecular networks. Drawing on both cutting-edge research and the historical milestones that shaped microbiology, it illuminates how bacteria navigate the intersection of genetic adaptation and ecological resilience. Designed for college students, interdisciplinary researchers, and even the determined amateur, Aswin Seshasayee moves beyond technical jargon to provide a thought-provoking synthesis of bacterial evolution and adaptation. Unlike traditional genomics texts, this book blends historical insights with contemporary discoveries, offering a fresh perspective on the role of bacteria in shaping the living world."--Publisher's website. 0aBacterial genetics. 0aGenomes. 0aBacteriaxEvolution.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0446zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0446.jpgzConnect to cover image04107nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000290028124501130031026400470042326400110047030000600048133600260054133700260056733800360059350000440062950600480067353800360072154001820075750000660093950400820100550506840108752015940177165000270336565000310339265000340342365000170345771000380347485600570351285600920356999101723500830896620250606162933.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250317t20252025enka    sbq   001 0 eng d  z9781805111719 (hbk.)  z9781805111702 (pbk.)  a9781805111726q(pdf)  a9781805111757q(HTML)  a9781805111733q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1505909711  aStSaULbengerda1 aLameris, Bregt,eauthor.10aFeeling colour :bchromatic embodiment in film culture, 1950s-1960sh[electronic resource] /cBregt Lameris. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (vi, 300 pages) :b206 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Set against the intersection of media studies, emotion theory, biology, and digital humanities, Feeling Colour: Chromatic Embodiment in Film Culture (1950s-1960s) delves into the role colour played in the oft-fraught relationship between cinema and its audiences. This transnational analysis of an extensive range of midcentury cinematography examines the multilayered effects which extend beyond the silver screen, offering a high-level theoretical elaboration and in-depth historical exploration of both experimental and mainstream movies. Lameris takes an interdisciplinary perspective, examining the different ways colour creates-or was believed to create-embodied reactions. From perception theory and 'putting the nerves in motion', to colour psychology and how to 'steer' the spectator, to cross-modal perception (or 'synaesthesia'), Lameris asks how how colours and feelings in film are entangled in the colour cultures, discourses and beliefs of a particular historical context. With its influential cultural scholarly contribution and accessible writing style, this book will delight both students and specialists in film and media studies. In addition, those interested in the history and use of color in advertising, neuroscience, gender studies, and emotion will find the book engaging and useful."--Publisher's website. 0aColor motion pictures. 0aColors in motion pictures. 0aColorxPsychological aspects. 0aSynesthesia.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0380zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0380.jpgzConnect to cover image07277nam a2200601 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100130027424503300028724600510061726400470066826400110071530000420072633600260076833700260079433800360082050000440085650600480090053800360094854001820098450000700116650002270123650400510146350530230151454600240453752014930456160000200605465000210607465000220609565000230611765000240614070000300616470000330619470000270622770000340625470000310628870000360631970000370635571000380639274000400643083000560647085600570652685600920658399101723500840896620250606161807.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250317t20252025enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805115809 (hbk.)  z9781805115793 (pbk.)  a9781805115816q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1506476453  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaheb00aInterconnected traditions :bSemitic languages, literatures, and cultures : a Festschrift for Geoffrey Khan.nVolume 2,pThe medieval world, Judaeo-Arabic, and neo-Aramaich[electronic resource] /cedited by Aaron D.

This Festschrift, celebrating a distinguished career that culminated in his tenure (2012-2025) as Regius Professor of Hebrew in the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Cambridge, brings together contributions from a vast and representative array of scholars-retired, established, and up and coming-whose work has been influenced by his vast intellectual legacy. Reflecting the interconnected traditions that Khan has illuminated throughout his career, this volume presents cutting-edge research on Hebrew and Aramaic linguistics, historical syntax, manuscript studies, and the transmission of textual traditions across centuries and cultures. Contributors engage with topics central to Khan's scholarship, including the evolution of the Biblical Hebrew verbal system, the intricacies of Masoretic notation, Geniza discoveries, Samaritan and medieval Judaeo-Arabic texts, and computational approaches to linguistic analysis. As Khan retires from his role as Regius Professor, this collection stands as both a tribute and a continuation of his work, honouring his lifelong dedication to understanding and preserving the linguistic and literary heritage of the Semitic world."--Publisher's website.10aKhan, Geoffrey. 0aHebrew language. 0aAramaic language. 0aSemitic languages. 0aSemitic literature.1 aKhan, Geoffrey,ehonoree.1 aHornkohl, Aaron D.,eeditor.1 aVidro, Nadia,eeditor.1 aWatson, Janet C.

Traditionally regarded as secondary to objective medical observations or rational ethical debates, color has been marginalized in these fields, considered subjective and inconsequential. However, this book reveals that color is critical in diagnostic and therapeutic practices and that it subconsciously influences moral interpretations in bioethics. Through examples like the 'blue hour'-a time of day associated with melancholy and creativity-readers are invited to consider color not just as a physical phenomenon explained by wavelengths and visual physiology, but as a medium rich with emotional and metaphorical meaning. From 'feeling blue' to seeing the world in 'black and white', color conveys complex messages that inform our perceptions of health, morality, and identity. By bridging the gap between science, emotion, and ethics, this book illuminates how colors impact our worldviews, urging readers to consider the subtle yet significant ways that color influences our understanding of ourselves and the world around us."--Publisher's website. 0aColorxPsychological aspects. 0aColorxPhysiological effect. 0aPerceptionxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aMedical ethics.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0443zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0443.jpgzConnect to cover image04083nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028110000330029324501120032626400470043826400110048530000700049633600260056633700260059233800360061850000440065450600480069853800360074654001820078250000660096450400530103050509560108352013420203965000470338161000340342871000380346285600570350085600920355799101723893410896620250606163046.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250321t20252025enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114543 (hbk.)  z9781805114536 (pbk.)  a9781805114550q(pdf)  a9781805114574q(HTML)  a9781805114567q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1510683897  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk-en1 aNewsholme, Richard,eauthor.10aMusic, religion, and politics at Worcester Cathedral, 680-1950h[electronic resource] /cRichard Newsholme. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xiv, 306 pages) :b48 illustrations, 4 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

The author delves into how political shifts, public opinion, and national trends have influenced changes in the cathedral's practices over time, while also highlighting the distinct local dynamics at play. The book captures the fluctuating significance of liturgy and music across different eras, from the strict, ritualistic practices of Benedictine monks to the rejection of ceremonial traditions by Interregnum Non-Conformists. It traces how the form of worship evolved in response to the beliefs of church leaders, leading to periods of decline and revival in the cathedral's musical standards. Notably, the study explores Worcester's role in the development of British polyphony up to the 14th century and the comforting role of the choir during World War I. With a wealth of surviving Anglo-Saxon charters, medieval liturgical manuscripts, and unique polyphonic fragments, this volume offers rare insights into centuries-old practices. While it focuses on Worcester, the study reflects broader trends in English cathedral history, providing a vital resource for understanding the interplay of music, religion, and politics in the evolution of worship."--Publisher's website. 0aChurch musiczEnglandzWorcesterxHistory.20aWorcester CathedralxHistory.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0437zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0437.jpgzConnect to cover image05971nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004100130028110000300029424500900032424600200041424600220043426400470045626400110050330000380051433600260055233700260057833800360060450000440064050600480068453800360073254001650076850000640093350400480099754600490104550526130109452015210370765000400522865000460526871000380531485600570535285600920540999101725106240896620250606163923.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250407t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114734 (hbk.)  z9781805114727 (pbk.)  a9781805114741q(pdf)  a97818051147-5q(HTML)  a9781805114758q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1513235408  aStSaULbengerda0 aengagrc1 aPeek, Philip S.,eauthor.10aAncient Greek IIh[electronic resource] :ba 21st-century approach /cPhilip S.

Peek draws on his twenty-five years of teaching experience to present the ancient Greek language in an imaginative and accessible way that promotes creativity, deep learning, and diversity. The course is built on three pillars: memory, analysis, and logic. Readers memorize the top 550 most frequently occurring ancient Greek words, the essential word endings, the eight parts of speech, and the grammatical concepts they will most frequently encounter when reading authentic ancient texts. Analysis and logic exercises enable the identification of clitics and full words as well as the translation and parsing of genuine ancient Greek sentences, with compelling reading selections in English and in Greek offering starting points for contemplation, debate, and reflection. A series of thirty entries by James F. Patterson, using a simplified morphophonemic approach to understanding language improve readers' understanding of word formation, their vocabulary, and their ability to read and understand Ancient Greek. This combination of memory-based learning and concept- and skill-based learning gradually builds the confidence of the reader, teaching them how to learn by guiding them from a familiarity with the basics to proficiency in reading this beautiful language. Ancient Greek II: A 21st-Century Approach is written for high-school and university students, but is an instructive and rewarding text for anyone who wishes to learn ancient Greek."--Publisher's website. 0aGreek languagexStudy and teaching. 0aGreek languagevProblems, exercises, etc.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0441zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0441.jpgzConnect to cover image03509nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028110000330029324501390032626400470046526400110051230000400052333600260056333700260058933800360061550000440065150600480069553800360074354001800077950000640095950400530102350502630107652013690133965000510270865000330275965000470279265000250283971000380286485600570290285600920295999101725617310896620250606164023.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250410t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805115168 (hbk.)  z9781805115151 (pbk.)  a9781805115175q(pdf)  a9781805115199q(HTML)  a9781805115182q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1513235706  aStSaULbengerda  aa-mp---1 aTerbish, Baasanjav,eauthor.10aHumans, dogs, and other beingsh[electronic resource] :bmyths, stories, and history in the land of Genghis Khan /cBaasanjav Terbish. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (viii, 284 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC-4.0).

This groundbreaking book examines the complex relationships between the Mongols and four animals-dogs, marmots, cats, and camels-shedding light on a nomadic culture that is deeply intertwined with its natural environment. Drawing from rich ethnographic accounts, historical records, and personal memoir, the author, of Mongol origin, offers a vivid narrative that intertwines cultural insights with intimate reflections. Each chapter delves into the dual nature of these animals: as both beings of Mongol cosmology and as tangible, living creatures that shape and are shaped by human lives. From the fierce loyalty and sharp temper of dogs to the culinary and medicinal significance of marmots, the mortal symbolism of cats, and the nurturing bond embodied by camels, these animals reveal unique facets of Mongol life and values. Through these stories, the book invites readers to consider universal questions about humanity's relationship with animals, our evolving cultures, and the shared fears, loves, and beliefs that define us. Insightful and evocative, this work is a must-read for anyone intrigued by human-animal connections, nomadic traditions, and the anthropology of coexistence."--Publisher's website. 0aHuman-animal relationshipszMongoliaxHistory. 0aAnimalszMongoliaxFolklore.  aNomadszMongoliaxSocial life and customs. 0aMythologyzMongolia.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0450zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0450.jpgzConnect to cover image04901nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000260011102000250013702000250016202000260018702000260021303500220023904000210026124501260028226400470040826400110045530000670046633600260053333700260055933800360058550000440062150600480066553800360071354001680074950000640091750400510098150517470103252013170277960000190409665000370411565000600415270000270421270000290423971000380426885600570430685600920436399101726046270896620250606164122.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250410t20252025enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114314  (hbk.)  z9781805114307 (pbk.)  a9781805114321q(pdf)  a9781805114345q(HTML)  a9781805114338q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1514489641  aStSaULbengerda00aActive speechh[electronic resource] :bcritical perspectives on Teresa Deevy /cedited by Úna Kealy and Kate McCarthy. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xxx, 330 pages) :b20 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Acts of recovery in the 1980s and 1990s challenged Deevy's exclusion from the literary canon, reclaiming her contributions as significant to Irish drama and theatre. The recent resurgence of scholarship and productions evidences that, as a deafened woman and Irish playwright, Deevy's creative power continues to disrupt and tilt the canon of Irish drama, theatre, and performance. Essays within the collection explore how Deevy's work interrogates early to mid-twentieth century Irish social norms and ideologies and provide a rich context for understanding her plays. The collection highlights the interdisciplinary nature of research on Deevy and offers insights on her work through archival research, literary analysis, and practitioner perspectives from Deaf and hearing theatremakers. One of the collection's strengths lies in its collaborative and inclusive approach, showcasing diverse methodologies and rigorous scholarship. The chapters on archival research and practitioner perspectives offer compelling models and avenues for future studies. This volume is an essential resource for scholars, educators, and theatremakers alike."--Publisher's website.10aDeevy, Teresa. 0aDramatists, Irishy20th century. 0aIrish literaturexWomen authorsxHistory and criticism.1 aKealy, Úna,eeditor.1 aMcCarthy, Kate,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0432zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0432.jpgzConnect to cover image04263nam a2200421 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000260011102000250013702000250016202000260018702000260021303500220023904000210026110000500028224500870033226400470041926400110046630000400047733600260051733700260054333800360056950000440060550600480064953800360069754001820073350000640091550400510097950509130103052016000194365000560354365000550359971000380365485600570369285600920374999101726799440896620250606164258.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250418t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805115526  (hbk.)  z9781805115519 (pbk.)  a9781805115533q(pdf)  a9781805115557q(HTML)  a9781805115540q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1517206138  aStSaULbengerda1 aIsbell, John Claiborne,eauthor,etranslator.10aWomen writers in the Romantic Ageh[electronic resource] /cJohn Claiborne Isbell. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (viii, 362 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Framed by revolutionary upheavals, the book explores how women writers shaped and reflected Romanticism's global currents. It fills a critical scholarly gap, connecting disparate traditions and uncovering voices often overlooked in male-dominated literary histories. Through concise entries, the book names every woman writer identified in its vast research, from celebrated figures like Phillis Wheatley to lesser-known authors whose manuscripts lay buried in archives. Each entry provides essential biographical details, while select excerpts in seventeen languages bring these voices to life, revealing how women navigated the era's revolutionary ideals and patriarchal barriers. Structured democratically, the volume treats all writers equally-whether anonymous, pseudonymous, or celebrated in their time. It highlights their diverse experiences: poets and novelists, abolitionists and suffragists, mothers and mill workers. From memoirs to political tracts, their works testify to the rich tapestry of women's contributions to Romanticism. By illuminating these stories, this book challenges national silos, offering a panoramic view of Romanticism as a truly transnational, female-inclusive phenomenon. It represents a go-to resource for students and interested readers, while setting the ground for future scholars to expand this vital field of study."--Publisher's website. 0aWomen authorsy19th centuryxHistory and criticism. 0aRomanticismxWomen authorsxHistory and criticism.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0458zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0458.jpgzConnect to cover image03358nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000260011102000250013702000250016202000260018702000260021303500220023904000210026110000550028224500930033726400470043026400110047730000390048833600260052733700260055333800360057950000440061550600480065953800360070754001820074350000640092550400530098950502330104252013260127560000490260165000340265065000530268471000380273785600570277585600920283299101726799450896620250606164212.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250418t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114444  (hbk.)  z9781805114437 (pbk.)  a9781805114451q(pdf)  a9781805114475q(HTML)  a9781805114468q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1517206148  aStSaULbengerda1 aParker, G.

This book deals with the task of bearing witness to anguish, atrocity, and madness, as these are staged in the tragic theatre. Focusing on the relationship between the protagonist and the onlooker or witness, it explores how the tragic figure, often and understandably viewed as alien or culpable or profoundly strange, struggles to be understood. Centred on Shakespeare, its wide-ranging approach also introduces works by (among others) the Greeks, Racine, Ibsen, Pirandello, Kafka, Beckett, and Kane. The discussion intersects with trauma studies and with psychoanalytic theory, especially around how subjective experience is 'held' by others. The challenge of entering into such difficult experience is likened to the offering of hospitality to the foreigner or stranger: the challenge of overcoming xenophobia. Another large concern is with how tragedy represents madness, and how far such states of mind may be shared with an audience, particularly through the lens of King Lear. Written in an accessible style, this book grounds tragedy in matters that resonate in common experience, from mental breakdown and our need to be heard to questions around grieving, trauma, and the ethics of telling someone's story."--Publisher's website.10aShakespeare, William,d1564-1616xTragedies. 0aPsychic trauma in literature. 0aNarration (Rhetoric)xMoral and ethical aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0435zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0435.jpgzConnect to cover image06414nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026924501910029026400460048126400110052730000520053833600260059033700260061633800360064249000480067850000440072650600480077053800360081854001840085450000640103850400510110250519230115352022500307665000260532665000290535265000330538165000330541465000380544770000280548570000330551370000330554670000320557970000370561171000380564883000490568685600570573585600920579299101727523450896620250606164349.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250428t20252025enkd    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805115311 (Hardback)  z9781805115304 (Paperback)  a9781805115328q(pdf)  a9781805115342q(HTML)  a9781805115335q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1517206087  aStSaULbengerda00aCoral conservation :bglobal evidence for the effects of actionsh[electronic resource] /cAnn Thornton, William H.

This comprehensive synthesis of global scientific evidence examines the effectiveness of conservation and restoration actions targeting stony, soft and cold-water coral species inhabiting a diverse range of marine habitats in tropical, temperate and arctic waters from shallow coasts to the deep sea.Addressing the urgent threats posed by climate change, invasive species, overfishing, and habitat destruction, this work summarizes evidence from actions in three core themes: protecting healthy reefs, mitigating human impacts, and undertaking active restoration. From establishing Marine Protected Areas to innovative techniques like coral gardening, the synopsis summarizes the evidence for practical actions and offers insights into their outcomes and applicability. Designed to guide decision-makers-resource managers, conservationists, policymakers, and local advocates-as well as those curious to learn about actions that could help corals, this accessible guide provides succinct information to support evidence-based conservation. By identifying the existing evidence and highlighting gaps in the knowledge, Coral Conservation can support practitioners and policymakers to allocate resources effectively by prioritising actions that work. By doing more of what works, we can reverse the loss of coral species and restore these vital habitats for the benefit of current and future generations. The authors consulted an international group of coral experts and conservationists to produce this synopsis. Funding was provided by A.G. Leventis Foundation and Oceankind. Coral Conservation is the 25th publication in the Conservation Evidence Series Synopses, and is freely available from the online Conservation Evidence database (www.conservationevidence.com) ensuring that users have ongoing access to updated research and assessments. Others in the series include Eel Conservation in Inland Habitats, Biodiversity of Marine Artificial Structures, Sub-tidal Benthic Invertebrate Conservation, Marine and Freshwater Mammal Conservation, and Marine Fish Conservation."--Publisher's website. 0aCoralsxConservation. 0aCoral reef conservation. 0aCoral reef animalsxEcology. 0aMarine habitat conservation. 0aMarine biodiversity conservation.1 aThornton, Ann,eauthor.1 aMorgan, William H.,eauthor.1 aBladon, Eleanor K.,eauthor.1 aSmith, Rebecca K.,eauthor.1 aSutherland, William J.,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aConservation evidence series synopses ;v25.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0453zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0453.jpgzConnect to cover image04576nam a2200481 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026924501180029026400460040826400110045430000780046533600260054333700260056933800360059550000440063150600480067553800360072354001630075950000640092250400510098650511230103752015220216065000100368265000240369265000460371665000350376265000180379770000340381570000310384970000270388071000380390785600570394585600920400299101729348210896620250606164537.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250506t20252025enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805115014 (Hardback)  z9781805115007 (Paperback)  a9781805115021q(pdf)  a9781805115045q(HTML)  a9781805115038q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1518356530  aStSaULbengerda00aImagery of hate onlineh[electronic resource] /cedited by Matthias J.

In digital spaces, hate speech is increasingly conveyed through memes, images, and videos, blending textual and pictorial elements to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and other exclusionary narratives. While historical perspectives on hate imagery are well-documented, this collection emphasises the pressing need for contemporary analysis of visual and multimodal communication in digital environments. Featuring contributions from interdisciplinary experts, this volume investigates the content, structure, and dynamics of normalisation of visual hate speech. By examining memes, manipulated images, and other visual artifacts, it reveals how hateful content gains traction in digital public spheres, often blurring traditional boundaries of acceptability. Through rigorous case studies and theoretical insights, the anthology provides a comprehensive understanding of how multimodality shapes hate discourse and its societal impact. Grounded in empirical research, this collection also addresses the challenges of defining and analysing hate ideologies, offering nuanced frameworks for distinguishing legitimate critique from hate-based narratives. Decoding Visual Hate is an essential resource for scholars, policymakers, teachers, and digital communicators seeking to combat the proliferation of visual hate and foster more inclusive online spaces."--Publisher's website. 0aHate. 0aOnline hate speech. 0aVisual communicationxDigital techniques. 0aDigital mediaxSocial aspects. 0aAntisemitism.1 aBecker, Matthias J.,eeditor.1 aScheiber, Marcus,eeditor.1 aJensen, Uffa,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0447zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0447.jpgzConnect to cover image03687nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026910000290029024501500031926400460046926400110051530000690052633600260059533700260062133800360064750000440068350600480072753800360077554001650081150000640097650000310104050400670107150504640113852014080160265000340301065000340304465000260307885600570310485600920316199101729348220896620250606164445.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250506t20252025enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805115212 (Hardback)  z9781805115205 (Paperback)  a9781805115229q(pdf)  a9781805115243q(HTML)  a9781805115236q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1518045573  aStSaULbengerda  aLahham, Fatima,eauthor.10aImprovising otherwiseh[electronic resource] :ba decolonial feminist approach to improvisation in early modern English culture /cFatima Lahham. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2025. 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xiv, 182 pages) :b18 illustrations, 1 table.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).

Fatima Lahham delves into the improvisational practices of early modern England, situating them within a rich tapestry of musical sources, theological texts, travel narratives, and natural histories. Inspired by Sara Ahmed's notion of the "feminist ear," the book amplifies voices and histories often unheard, re-examining the cultural interplay between England and the Ottoman Empire in the seventeenth century. This groundbreaking study bridges disciplines and engages with critical race studies to explore decolonial methodologies. Lahham challenges traditional historiographies, integrating improvisation studies and early modern creativity to transform our understanding of historical performance and inspire new practices today. Tracks from her album punctuate the text, fostering an innovative, multi-modal reading experience, while creative prompts invite readers to craft their own improvisations. At once scholarly and imaginative, this book expands the boundaries of historically informed performance and cultural studies. By mobilizing improvisation as a tool for understanding and re-imagining history, Imagining Otherwise offers a vital contribution to early music, feminist theory, and the study of England's global engagements."--Publisher's website. 0aMusiczEnglandy15th century. 0aMusiczEnglandy16th century. 0aImprovisation (Music)40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0451zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0451.jpgzConnect to cover image04720nam a2200601 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026924500760029026400460036626400110041230000390042333600260046233700260048833800360051450000440055050600480059453800360064254001820067850000640086050001090092450003760103350400390140950504400144852015670188865000150345565000260347070000260349670000290352270000330355170000370358470000310362170000290365270000360368170000320371770000260374970000300377570000290380570000250383470000390385971000330389871000380393185600570396985600920402699101730818760896620250606164727.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250515t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805115113 (Hardback)  z9781805115106 (Paperback)  a9781805115120q(pdf)  a9781805115144q(HTML)  a9781805115137q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1519849446  aStSaULbengerda00aBioethics :ba coursebookh[electronic resource] /cCompost Collective. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2025. 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xii, 152 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

It challenges conventional boundaries, embracing Van Rensselaer Potter's vision of bioethics as a global, holistic ethics of life-integrating human health, environmental considerations, and transdisciplinary insights. Through engaging discussions, thought experiments, and case studies, the book empowers students to critically reflect on ethical questions without dictating rigid answers. Topics range from the historical roots of ethical thought to cutting-edge debates in molecular biology, such as epigenetics and exposomics, demonstrating how interconnected human, animal, and environmental health truly are. Central themes include the limits of scientific knowledge, the biases shaping research, and the evolving interplay between moral philosophy and empirical science. Students will encounter key philosophical frameworks-ontology, epistemology, and ethics-woven into practical bioethical applications. Feminist philosophy, experimental bioethics, and embedded ethics enrich this perspective, urging readers to question assumptions, embrace diverse viewpoints, and connect ethical principles with real-world science.Targeted at students in philosophy, biology, biomedical sciences, and bioengineering, this book is a toolkit for future thinkers, fostering a nuanced understanding of how ethical science advances humanity in a complex, ever-changing world."--Publisher's website. 0aBioethics. 0aMedicinexPhilosophy.1 aKenis, Daan,eauthor.1 aMertens, Mayli,eauthor.1 aVulliermet, Franlu,eauthor.1 aPaleri, Varsha Aravind,eauthor.1 aRatajczyk, Yanni,eauthor.1 aMoormann, Emma,eauthor.1 aStadlbauer, Christina,eauthor.1 aVandeput, Bartaku,eauthor.1 aBuyst, Nele,eauthor.1 aMeinen, Lisanne,eauthor.1 aHens, Kristien,eauthor.1 aDevos, Ina,eauthor.1 aVillafuerte, Ilya Gordon,eauthor.2 aCOMPOST Collective,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0449zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0449.jpgzConnect to cover image05959nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026924502390029026400460052926400110057530000790058633600260066533700260069133800360071750000440075350600480079753800360084554001820088150000640106350400510112750521770117852017420335565000330509765000470513065000320517765000430520970000320525270000300528471000380531485600570535285600920540999101730818840896620250606164638.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250513t20252025enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114673 (Hardback)  z9781805114666 (Paperback)  a9781805114680q(pdf)  a9781805114703q(HTML)  a9781805114697q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1519849582  aStSaULbengerda02aA field guide to cross-cultural research on childhood learning :btheoretical, methodological, practical and ethical considerations for an interdisciplinary fieldh[electronic resource] /cedited by Sheina Lew-Levy and Stephen Asatsa. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2025. 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xxxiv, 366 pages) :b14 colour illustrations, 5 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Recent studies highlight a concerning over-reliance on data from post-industrialized western countries, raising questions about the broader applicability of findings. This book seeks to provide a comprehensive solution, bridging the gap between theory and practice. It offers a unique guide for researchers by combining interdisciplinary perspectives from anthropology, psychology, education, and beyond. With over 60 contributors from 21 countries, the book weaves together diverse cultural insights, challenging the narrow scope of traditional research. Each chapter features multiple perspectives, creating a coherent and thoughtful discussion of essential topics such as cultural learning, childhood, and the historical and social forces shaping development.' A Field Guide to Cross-Cultural Research on Childhood Learning' goes beyond theoretical discussions by offering practical advice on fieldwork, ethics, and engaging policymakers. By centering marginalized voices and emphasizing community agency, it strives to democratize developmental research. The format is innovative, merging the breadth of encyclopedic entries with the depth of cohesive chapters. Moreover personal reflections and photographs embedded in the book will give readers a window into the experiences of those involved in cross-cultural research on children. This accessible, academically rigorous volume is a must-read for scholars seeking to advance inclusive and sustainable research on childhood learning, and anybody interested in child development in a worldwide perspective."--Publisher's website. 0aChild developmentxResearch. 0aChild developmentvCross-cultural studies. 0aChild psychologyxResearch. 0aPsychologyxMoral and ethical aspects.1 aLew-Leivy, Sheina,eeditor.1 aAsatsa, Stephen,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0440zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0440.jpgzConnect to cover image04664nam a2200541 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031404300120033524501510034726400460049826400110054430000590055533600260061433700260064033800360066649000430070250000440074550600480078953800360083754001790087350000640105250400670111650510260118352013530220963000270356263000710358963000490366063000400370963000230374970000300377270000280380270000670383071000380389783000380393585600570397385600920403099101731814350896620250606165553.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250522t20252025enka    sb    001 0aeng d  z9781805114888 (Hardback)  z9781805114871 (Paperback)  a9781805114895q(pdf)  a9781805114918q(HTML)  a9781805114901q(EPUB)  z2753-8036 (Print)  z2753-8044 (Online)(Oa(OCoLC)1520583085  aStSaULbengerda  ae------00aQur'an translations in the Eastern Bloc and beyondh[electronic resource]  /cedited by Elvira Kulieva, with Johanna Pink and Mykhaylo Yakubovych. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2022. 4c©2022  a1 online resource (xvi, 324 pages) :b9 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe Global Qur'anx2753-8044 ;vvol. 3  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license.

With a focus on how Islamic texts have been shaped by state policies, ideological shifts, and religious identities, it traces connections between these regions and the wider world, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and China. This volume draws on perspectives from both Sunni and Shia traditions, as well as contributions by non-Muslim scholars. Through archival research and close textual analysis, the contributors demonstrate how translations of the Qur'an have served not only as religious texts but also as reflections of profound transformations in national and religious identities in communist and post-communist societies. Qur'an translations have gained prominence within the modern Muslim publishing world, and their analysis reveals a dynamic interplay between local politics and global Islamic discourse.

This innovative handbook addresses the interplay of national, European, and transnational rules governing relationships between private actors, including individuals and businesses. Designed with students in mind, this volume not only covers foundational concepts but also explores cutting-edge developments in areas such as contract, tort, property, and company law. What sets this handbook apart is its contextual approach. By integrating societal and theoretical perspectives, it encourages students to critically evaluate private law's role in addressing global challenges like digitalization, sustainability, and globalization. Gathering the expertise of over twenty international law scholars, the handbook reflects the expertise of academics deeply engaged in teaching and research. With structured chapters and accessible narratives, this handbook replaces piecemeal materials previously used in courses. It offers coherence and depth, making it an essential resource for understanding the legal frameworks that shape commerce, legal practice, and broader societal issues. Whether for mandatory or elective courses, this guide empowers students to navigate and critically assess the dynamic field of European private law providing an essential resource for the private lawyers of the future."--Publisher's website. 0aCivil lawzEurope. 0aDigital communicationsxLaw and legislationzEurope. 0aContractszEurope.1 aBartl, Marija,eeditor.1 aBurgers, Laura,d1989-eeditor.1 aMak, Chantal,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0448zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0448.jpgzConnect to cover image04624nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026904300210029024501280031126400470043926400110048630000680049733600260056533700260059133800360061750000440065350600480069753800360074554002010078150000640098250400390104650513030108552012380238865000320362665000340365865000310369265000330372365000270375665000290378365000430381265000450385570000310390071000380393185600570396985600920402699101731823450896620250701123805.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250605t20252025enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805115625 (Hardback)  z9781805115618 (Paperback)  a9781805115632q(pdf)  a9781805115656q(HTML)  a9781805115649q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1522141614  aStSaULbengerda  aaw-----afn-----00aHousing, heritage and urbanisation in the Middle East and North Africah[electronic resource] /cedited by Lilia Makhloufi. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xxiv, 194 pages) :b50 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution  4.0 International No-Commercial No-Derivatives (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.

Bringing together architects, archaeologists, urban sociologists, urban designers, urban planners and landscape architects, this multi-authored and interdisciplinary volume presents diverse case studies from the Middle East and North Africa, shedding light on the past, present and future of residential spaces. With its focus to traditional, modern and contemporary housing in Egypt, Iran, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia, Housing, Heritage and Urbanisation in the Middle East and North Africa explores the correlation between architecture, urban planning and society. The contributors critique the impact of rapid urbanisation and global architectural standardisation, which often goes beyond local identity. Instead, they advocate for a sustainable urban development rooted in community needs and cultural heritage. Ultimately, this volume argues that successful urban planning must balance modernity with tradition, ensuring that housing reflects the lived experiences of its inhabitants. A crucial read for scholars and practitioners, it reaffirms that sustainable cities must be shaped by local needs, not just global trends."--Publisher's website. 0aCity planningzMiddle East. 0aCity planningzAfrica, North. 0aUrbanizationzMiddle East. 0aUrbanizationzAfrica, North. 0aLand usezMiddle East. 0aLand usezAfrica, North. 0aArchitecture and societyzMiddle East. 0aArchitecture and societyzAfrica, North.1 aMakhloufi, Lilia,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0460zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0460.jpgzConnect to cover image04134nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031410000290033524500570036426400470042126400110046830000680047933600260054733700260057333800360059949000550063550000440069050600480073453800360078254001850081850000640100350000550106750400530112250504800117552014520165565000410310765000200314865000250316865000350319370000380322871000970326671000380336383000540340185600570345585600920351299101731823540896620250701123909.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250603t20252025enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114109 (Hardback)  z9781805114093 (Paperback)  a9781805114116q(pdf)  a9781805114130q(HTML)  a9781805114123q(epub)  z2050-7933 (Print)  a2054-362X (Online)  a(OCoLC)1521445115  aStSaULbengerda1 aFinnegan, Ruth,eauthor.10aOral poetryh[electronic resource] /cRuth Finnegan. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xxiv, 404 pages) :b41 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aWorld oral literature seriesx2054-362X ;vvol. 14  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial  4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Taking a broad comparative approach, it explores oral poetry across Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, and the Americas. Drawing on global research, Ruth Finnegan, the author of the seminal Oral Literature in Africa, sheds light on key debates such as the nature of oral tradition, the relationship between poetry and society, the differences between oral and written forms, and the role of poets in predominantly non-literate contexts. Written from a primarily anthropological and literary perspective, this study contributes to the socio-cultural aspects of verbal art while also engaging with the literary dimensions of poetry which happens at any given moment to be unwritten. Finnegan's clear, non-technical language and extensive use of translated examples make this work accessible to a wide audience, appealing not only to sociologists and anthropologists but also to those with an interest in poetry, in comparative literature, and in global folk traditions. The re-issue of this classic study is now augmented by further illustrations and a newly written Introduction and Conclusion, situating it in the context of the contemporary study of literature."--Publisher's website. 0aFolk poetryxHistory and  criticism. 0aOral tradition. 0aNarration (Rhetoric) 0aOral interpretation of poetry.1 aTurin, Mark,ewriter of foreword.2 aCambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.bWorld Oral Literature Project.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWorld oral literature series ;vv. 14.x2054-362X40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0428zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0428.jpgzConnect to cover image04553nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026924501750029026400470046526400110051230000370052333600260056033700260058633800360061250000440064850600480069253800360074054001820077650000640095850400510102250512010107352014380227465000270371265000420373965000330378170000300381470000300384470000340387471000380390885600570394685600920400399101735192210896620250701123556.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250624t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805114499 (Hardback)  z9781805114482 (Paperback)  a9781805114505q(pdf)  a9781805114529q(HTML)  a9781805114512q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1525466826  aStSaULbengerda00aGender-based violence in arts and cultureh[electronic resource] :bperspectives on education and work /cedited by Marie Buscatto, Sari Karttunen and Mathilde Provansal. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (x, 221 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

This collection of essays delves into both the overt and subtle forms of GBV. It spans sexual harassment, assault, and the everyday sexism ingrained in creative workplaces and art schools, in both professional and private dimensions. The book covers a wide array of artistic sectors-opera, visual arts, music, and theatre-across diverse global contexts, from Europe to Asia and North America. By incorporating feminist and sociological theories, the essays not only examine the structural power dynamics that perpetuate GBV but also highlight efforts to challenge and dismantle these systems. The book addresses both criminal acts of violence and the "ordinary" forms of sexism that pervade artistic spaces, making visible the normalized patterns of behavior that maintain gender inequality. The volume is divided into three parts: the production of GBV, its representations in cultural work, and the initiatives to counteract it.

Students are disengaged, lecturers are burned out, and universities seem more preoccupied with rankings and revenue than with knowledge and wellbeing. But rather than dwell on the problems, this book focuses on solutions-on hope. Bringing together a diverse range of educators and practitioners, this collection showcases real-world innovations that challenge the status quo and offer glimpses of a more humane and inspiring educational future. From rethinking systems and curriculum design to fostering imaginative collaboration and exploring the role of technology, the book highlights practical, hopeful interventions that are already making a difference. This is not a manifesto of complaints but an invitation to reimagine education. The contributors offer fresh perspectives from around the world, illustrating how small but meaningful changes can transform learning spaces, empower educators, and inspire students. For academics, teachers, administrators, and anyone invested in the future of education, this book serves as both a source of inspiration and a call to action. It is an evolving ecosystem of ideas-grounded in practice, rich with possibility, and rooted in radical hope. Now is the time to create the change we wish to see."--Publisher's website. 0aEducation, Higher. 0aHigh education and state. 0aEducation, HigherxTechnological innovations. 0aCollege teachersxTraining of1 aAbegglen, Sandra,eeditor.1 aBurns, Tom,eeditor.1 aHeller, Richard,eeditor.1 aMadhok, Rajan,eeditor.1 aNeuhaus, Fabian,eeditor.

Triggered by an oppressive poll tax but fuelled by deeper injustices, this uprising saw land workers, artisans, and commoners rise to challenge the authority of landowners, church, and crown. 'When Katherine Brewed' brings this momentous event to life on stage, blending historical fidelity with a bold, radical perspective. Drawing from chronicles and centuries of literary reinterpretation, this devised play reveals the struggles of the forgotten: those who dared to dream of a world free from exploitation and tyranny. Through the lens of class struggle and solidarity, the story of Wat Tyler, John Ball, and their fellow rebels unfolds, exposing the duplicity of rulers and the undying hope of those who resist. Echoing the spirit of radical theatre traditions, this play reimagines this medieval rebellion with contemporary relevance, urging audiences to reflect on enduring issues of inequality and power. Both an homage to the past and a rallying cry for the future, this production is as much a tribute to those who fought as it is an invitation to envision a world transformed. Witness history, and the lessons it still hol"--Publisher's website. 0aTyler's Insurrection, 1381. 0aPeasant uprisingszGreat BritainxHistoryyTo 1500. 0aSocial classeszEnglandxHistoryyTo 1500. 0aTyler's Insurrection, 1381vDrama. 0aRadical theaterzGreat Britain.1 aCresswell, John,eauthor.12iContains (expression):aCresswell, John.tWhen Katherine brewed.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aApplied theatre praxis series ;vv. 4.x2515-076640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0456zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0456.jpgzConnect to cover image05032nam a2200493 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022103500220024704000210026924501190029024600330040926400470044226400110048930000650050033600260056533700260059133800360061750000440065350600480069753800360074554001840078150000640096550400410102950514730107052014970254365000180404065000360405865000450409465000590413965000410419865100420423965100420428170000280432371000380435185600570438985600920444699101735404700896620250701123339.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250701t20252025enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805116691 (Hardback)  z9781805116684 (Paperback)  a9781805116707q(pdf)  a9781805116721q(HTML)  a9781805116714q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1525459709  aStSaULbengerda00a'Thou shalt not stand idly by'h[electronic resource] :bJews of conscience on Palestine /cSusan Landau (editor).3 aThou shalt not stand idly by 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xviii, 148 pages) : colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Bridging history, politics, theology, and conflict studies, this book traces a moral and intellectual tradition of resistance from within the global Jewish community-one rooted in values of justice, equality, and compassion. From early twentieth-century critics like Ahad Ha'am and Hannah Arendt to contemporary scholars, rabbis, journalists, and activists, the voices gathered here challenge the dominant narratives that conflate Judaism with Zionism. As violence escalates in Gaza and misinformation clouds public understanding, this book offers essential historical context and urgently needed counter-narratives. Through curated quotes, essays, and reflections, it documents how generations of Jews have spoken out-often at personal cost-against militarism, racism, and settler colonialism. In doing so, it reclaims an ethical tradition that links solidarity with Palestine with all struggles for justice throughout the world. This is an anti-war, anti-prejudice book for anyone seeking clarity amid polarization. In this unprecedented political moment, it is an essential resource for educators, activists, faith leaders, and all who value human rights. By amplifying voices of conscience, it deepens our understanding of Israel-Palestine relations and reminds us of the enduring power of moral dissent."--Publisher's website. 0aAnti-Zionism. 0aSettler colonialismzPalestine. 0aHuman rightszPalestinexPublic opinion. 0aLand settlementxMoral and ethical aspectszPalestine. 0aJewsxPolitical activityzPalestine. 0aPalestinexForeign relationszIsrael. 0aIsraelxForeign relationszPalestine.1 aLandau, Susan,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0481zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0481.jpgzConnect to cover image04420nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028110000300029324501410032326400470046426400110051130000400052233600260056233700260058833800360061450000440065050600480069453800360074254001980077850000640097650400670104050508340110752016390194165000490358065000510362965000450368065000500372571000380377585600570381385600920387099101739126070896620251007154839.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250801t20252025enk     sb    000 d eng d  z9781805116493 (hbk.)  z9781805116486 (pbk.)  a9781805116509q(pdf)  a9781805116523q(HTML)  a9781805116516q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1530081565  aStSaULbengerda  an-us---1 aEswaran, Mukesh,eauthor.14aThe economics of cultural lossh[electronic resource] :bharm and resilience in North American indigenous communities /cMukesh Eswaran. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (viii, 210 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

In this groundbreaking book, Mukesh Eswaran confronts these urgent questions through the lens of economics, focusing deeply on an underexplored aspect: the erosion of Indigenous culture. While empirical studies have shed some light on Indigenous struggles, Eswaran argues that mainstream economic theory fails to grasp the unique realities of Indigenous communities. His work introduces innovative models that incorporate cultural and communal values-particularly the sacredness of land and the importance of extended family and communal life-as foundational components of Indigenous well-being. Eswaran emphasizes that policies rooted in conventional economics, which often ignore culture, are ill-suited to address Indigenous issues, in particular, what has been identified as 'Deaths of Despair' among Indigenous Peoples. Drawing from Indigenous scholars and Elders, he shows how historical trauma-passed through generations-has systematically dismantled cultural and communal supports. His theoretical framework helps explain the rise in substance abuse and suicide, and points toward new, culturally sensitive policy approaches. While advancing economic theory relevant to Indigenous issues, the book also proposes a meaningful path toward healing and justice for Indigenous communities. It is a vital read for economists, policymakers, students, and anyone concerned with Indigenous history, well-being, equity and reconciliation."--Publisher's website. 0aIndians of North AmericaxSocial conditions. 0aIndians of North AmericaxEconomic conditions. 0aIndians of North AmericaxMental health. 0aCultural propertyxProtectionzUnited States.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0477zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0477.jpgzConnect to cover image09246nam a2200553 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100130027404300120028710000260029924501600032526400470048526400110053230000370054333600260058033700260060633800360063249000670066850000440073550600480077953800360082754001660086350000700102950000920109950400690119154600410126050548810130152019830618260000210816565000340818665000380822065100430825865100370830170000360833871000750837471000380844983000560848785600570854385600920860099101739126270896620251007154638.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250724t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805110712 (hbk.)  z9781805110705 (pbk.)  a9781805110729q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1528868114  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaheb  af-ua---11aArad, Dotan,eauthor.00a'Wisdom and greatness in one place' :bthe Alexandrian trader Moses ben Judah and his circleh[electronic resource] /cDotan Arad and Esther-Miriam Wagner. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (x, 538 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 37  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

A leader of the Jewish community in Alexandria, he was also a prominent businessman and in contact with individuals from Cairo to Sicily. This collection of documents at the Bodleian likely did not emerge from the Cairo Genizah, but from another depository, and appears to have been buried at some point. The documents, which include letters and deeds, shed light on the world of the Jewish elite of a Mediterranean city at the end of the Middle Ages, their communal and business life, connections between Jewish communities, and intellectual trends and tastes among educated Jews. They improve our understanding of the lives of Alexandrian Jews in the late Middle Ages and provide new data about the local leadership and its relations with the Nagidate (the central Jewish leadership) in Cairo, the cantors, the poll tax and its effects, and more. We hear about tensions within this society and the growing presence of European (Italian, Greek, Iberian, and conversos) Jews within the complex social mosaic of Egyptian Jewry in the late Mamluk period. The documents inform us about Alexandria's Jewish community and the commercial networks of the Mediterranean world, in which Jews traded alongside Christians and Muslims. This volume makes an important contribution to the study of Judaeo-Arabic at a watershed moment. Sources from the late Mamluk period show Judaeo-Arabic at a linguistic border between Classical and Late Judaeo-Arabic. The volume will therefore further readers' knowledge of historical linguistics of Arabic in general, and Judaeo-Arabic in particular. The phrase 'Wisdom and Greatness in One Place' in the title of the book is a quotation from the Babylonian Talmud (Giṭṭin 59a), the meaning of which is that it is rare to find combined in one man political leadership and intellectual pre-eminence."--Publisher's website.04aMoses ben Judah. 0aJudeo-Arabic languagevTexts. 0aJewszEgyptzAlexandriaxHistory. 0aAlexandria (Egypt)xIntellectual life. 0aAlexandria (Egypt)xCiviization.1 aWagner, Esther-Miriam,eauthor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 37.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0352zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0352.jpgzConnect to cover image05369nam a2200577 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100130027424502040028726400470049126400110053830000390054933600260058833700260061433800360064049000670067650000440074350600480078753800360083554001660087150000700103750000920110750400530119954600410125250515760129352012930286965000310416265000320419365000280422565000290425365000290428270000330431170000280434470000300437270000330440270000380443571000750447371000380454883000560458685600570464285600920469999101739126280896620251007153022.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250724t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805115496 (hbk.)  z9781805115489 (pbk.)  a9781805115502q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1528869534  aStSaULbengerda0 aengaheb00aReading :bperformance and materiality in Hebrew and Aramaic traditionsh[electronic resource] /cedited by Hector M.

The aim of the colloquium was to investigate Jewish approaches to the reading of texts, with a focus on reading practices that were applied to Hebrew and Aramaic texts in antiquity and the early Middle Ages. It explored, in particular, how these were shaped by material and non-textual aspects (oral traditions, performative context, philological values, etc). Among the questions it addressed were: How did non-textual components determine reading? To what extent did materiality shape or limit readings? How did reading practices shape the texts themselves? What values guided how texts were modified and variant texts evaluated? What determined which form or version of a text was read and according to what conventions? The responses to these questions collected in this volume highlight the tensions between authority and creativity, preservation and innovation, understanding and misapprehension, knowledge and ignorance, which shaped Jewish practices of reading."--Publisher's website. 0aHebrew languagexRhetoric. 0aAramaic languagexRhetoric. 0aHebrew languagevTexts. 0aAramaic languagevTexts. 0aReadingxSocial aspects.1 aPatmore, Hector M.,eeditor.1 aNajman, Hindy,eeditor.1 aSchorch, Stefan,eeditor.1 aVerrijssen, Jeroen,eeditor.1 aSchoor, Hanneke van der,eeditor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 36.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0457zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0457.jpgzConnect to cover image03419nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028110000310029324501270032426400470045126400110049830000580050933600260056733700260059333800360061950000440065550600480069953800360074754001720078350000640095550400660101950504950108552010850158065000410266565000390270665000410274571000380278685600570282485600920288199101739126400896620250721100907.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250721t20252025enka    sb    000 d eng d  z9781805116288 (hbk.)  z9781805116271 (pbk.)  a9781805116295q(pdf)  a9781805116318q(HTML)  a9781805116301q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1527102165  aStSaULbengerda  an-us---1 aBarrera, Roberto,eauthor.10aSurveillance and control of dengue vectors in the United States and territoriesh[electronic resource] /cRoberto Barrera. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xvi, 132 pages)b11 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is published under Creative Commons (CCo) "No rights reserved".

Conclusions to Volume 1: A Musical Life in Italy c.1501 / Tim Shephard, Annabelle Page, Ciara O'Flaherty, Oliver Doyle, Laura Ştefănescu.  a"This volume explores how everyday texts in Renaissance Italy engaged with music, sound, and hearing. Of the 358 known editions printed in 1501, only a few contained formal music notation or specialist theory. Yet a surprising wealth of musical knowledge emerges from religious texts, classical commentaries, lifestyle guides, poetry, and more. These sources-rarely penned by professional musicians-reflect the broader cultural presence of music in early 16th-century life, touching on themes like music's moral influence, its role in education, and its scientific understanding. Drawing from an ambitious cross-disciplinary survey, this groundbreaking study repositions everyday references to music as vital to understanding Renaissance musical culture. It challenges scholars to look beyond elite and theoretical traditions, and instead engage with the rich, often-overlooked world of non-specialist musical discourse. Set against the backdrop of 1501-a landmark year when Ottaviano Petrucci revolutionized music printing-this book offers a compelling snapshot of how music was understood and discussed by ordinary readers in Renaissance Italy. By sounding out these diverse voices, the project reimagines the contours of music history and opens new avenues for musicological inquiry."--Publisher's website. 0aMusiczItalyxHistoryy15th century. 0aMusiczItalyxHistoryy16th century. 0aMusicxSocial aspectszItalyxHistory and criticism. 0aHearingxSocial aspectszItalyxHistory and criticism.1 aOliver Doyle,eauthor.1 aO'Flaherty, Ciara,eauthor.1 aPage, Annabelle,eauthor.1 aŞtefănescu.

Their cultural significance is profound, but they also raise a wide range of questions. This book provides a comprehensive theory that guides the analysis and interpretation of characters across four dimensions: as represented beings with physical, psychological, and social characteristics; as artefacts with aesthetic structures; as meaningful symbols; and as symptoms of socio-cultural origins and effects. Integrating insights from film, media, and literary studies as well as philosophy, psychology and sociology, the book offers a broad range of approaches for understanding characters and the emotional responses they evoke. Richly illustrated and offering practical tools, along with case studies of numerous characters from different genres of films, this book will be invaluable to scholars and students of film and media studies and related disciplines, as well as artistic practitioners."--Publisher's website.  aTranslated from the German. 0aCharacters and characteristics in motion pictures. 0aAffect (Psychology) in motion pictures.1 aLowry, Stephen,etranslator.1 aEder, Jens.tFigur im Film.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0283zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0283.jpgzConnect to cover image03959nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026004300120028110000280029324501290032126400470045026400110049730000620050833600260057033700260059633800360062250000440065850600480070253800360075054002130078650000640099950400670106350504110113052015490154165000630309065000620315365100540321565100450326971000380331485600570335285600920340999101741526920896620250829122933.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||250815t20252025enka    sb    001 d eng d  z9781805115571 (hbk.)  z9781805115564 (pbk.)  a9781805115588q(pdf)  a9781805115601q(HTML)  a9781805115595q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1534046757  aStSaULbengerda  ae-uk-en1 aSaunders, Tom,eauthor.10aCity of capital and labourh[electronic resource] :bthe making and transformation of industrial Manchester /cTom Saunders. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xxii, 312 pages) :b238 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Richly illustrated and designed for both academic and general audiences, it sheds new light on Manchester's transformation during the Industrial Revolution, highlighting how the city's physical form shaped and was shaped by its socio-economic and cultural dynamics. By analysing architectural styles, building types, land use, and spatial relationships, the study identifies distinct phases of development from the early eighteenth to early twentieth century. It delves into how Manchester's material landscape mediated industrialisation and social tensions, reflecting the emergence of both bourgeois and proletarian communities. The book argues that the city's evolving physical structure was deeply intertwined with the capitalist logic of class relations, where architecture and urban spaces became arenas for competing social identities. Through mapping the enduring physical traces of these changes, and using a Marxist lens to examine shifting power structures in cities, the book underscores Manchester's role as a microcosm of industrial and urban transformation. It invites readers to rediscover the city's industrial heritage, emphasising the importance of its historic buildings in understanding the socio-economic forces that shaped modern urban life-before they are irrevocably altered by contemporary redevelopment"--Publisher's website. 0aCity planningzEnglandzManchesterxHistoryy19th century.  aUrban policyzEnglandzManchesterxHistoryy19th century. 0aManchester (England)xBuildings, structures, etc. 0aManchester (England)xSocial conditions.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0459zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0459.jpgzConnect to cover image04565nam a2200553 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100230027410000420029724501010033926400470044026400110048730000410049833600260053933700260056533800360059149000670062750000440069450600480073853800360078654001660082250000700098850000920105850400550115054600730120550502600127852017670153860000640330560000620336960000630343163000420349463000530353663000520358963000520364171000750369371000380376883000560380685600570386285600920391999101742346810896620250829105927.0m#####o##d########cr||n|||||||||240604t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805116387 (hbk.)  z9781805116370 (pbk.)  a9781805116394q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1534046954  aStSaULbengerda1 aengalatahebagrc1 aRodrigue, Paul,eauthor,etranslator.10aJerome's sources in his translation of the Hebrew Bibleh[electronic resource] :cPaul Rodrigue. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xviii, 350 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 38  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

The Translation of the Book of Esther / Paul Rodrigue -- 5. Conclusion / Paul Rodrigue.  a"At the close of the fourth century CE, Jerome of Stridon-renowned Latin scholar, theologian, and priest-undertook the monumental task of translating the Hebrew-Aramaic Bible into Latin. The result of this effort, now known as the Vulgate, has long been regarded as a foundational text of Western Christianity. In this volume, Paul Rodrigue investigates the sources that Jerome may have drawn upon in the process of translation. Far from being just a rendering of the Hebrew-Aramaic Bible, the Vulgate emerges as a layered and multifaceted translation, shaped not only by the Hebrew-Aramaic text but also by a broad array of additional sources. Through a series of carefully chosen case studies, Rodrigue analyses a number of verses from the Joseph narrative in Genesis, as well as from Daniel and Esther. Each Vulgate passage is meticulously compared with its equivalents in the Hebrew-Aramaic Bible, the Septuagint, the Latin translations of the Septuagint, the Greek versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and-where applicable-the Targumim and rabbinic writings. This comparative approach reveals Jerome's engagement with texts in four languages-Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin-and highlights his responses to both Jewish and Christian exegetical traditions. Importantly, the selected translations span Jerome's career as a translator of the Hebrew-Aramaic Bible: Daniel at its outset (392-393), Genesis mid-career (late 390s), and Esther at its close (404-405). As such, Rodrigue's analysis offers a chronologically nuanced study of Jerome's evolving translation method (sensus de sensu), providing invaluable insight for scholars of biblical studies, late antiquity, translation theory, and the transmission of sacred texts."--Publisher's website.00aJerome,cSaint,d-419 or 420xCriticism and interpretation.00aJerome,cSaint,d-419 or 420xKnowledgexGreek philology.00aJerome,cSaint,d-419 or 420xKnowledgexHebrew philology.00aBiblexTranslatingxHistoryvSources.00aBible.pGenesisxCriticism, interpretation, etc.00aBible.pDanielxCriticism, interpretation, etc.00aBible.pEstherxCriticism, interpretation, etc.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 38.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0474zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0474.jpgzConnect to cover image03200nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000260013602000250016203500220018704000210020904100130023010000370024324501620028026400470044226400110048930000400050033600260054033700260056633800360059250000440062850600480067253800360072054002320075650400670098854601090105550502020116452010160136660000370238260000580241965000490247770000530252671000380257985600570261785600920267499101742366720896620251007154922.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250829t20252025enk     sb    000 d eng d  z9781805116745 (hbk.)  z9781805116738  (pbk.)  a9781805116752q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1535231180  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghlat1 aPlautus, Titus Maccius,eauthor.10aCasina by Plautush[electronic resource] :ban annotated Latin text with a prose translation /cby Catherine Tracy (based on the Latin text of W.M.

Deception, disguise, and domestic conflict unfold as the old man's schemes are cleverly thwarted by his wife. Likely one of Plautus's later works, 'Casina' offers both linguistic challenge and comic brilliance, making it ideal for classroom use or independent study. This edition features the complete Latin text of the play, richly annotated with grammatical and vocabulary notes to support comprehension. A clear prose translation accompanies the original, offering accessible insight into the humor and intrigue of the play. The introduction provides historical and cultural context, situating the farce within ancient Athenian and Roman comedic traditions. This volume is designed for students with intermediate Latin skills who wish to engage directly with Plautus's lively comic play."--Publisher's website.10aPlautus, Titus Maccius.tCasina.10aPlautus, Titus MacciusxCriticism and interpretation. 0aLatin drama (Comedy)xHistory and criticism.1 aTracy, Catherine,eeditor,etranslator,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0482zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0482.jpgzConnect to cover image05219nam a2200469 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024502050028126400470048626400110053330000760054433600260062033700260064633800360067250000440070850600480075253800360080054001980083650000640103450400510109850514950114952016220264453600610426665000340432765000480436170000280440970000320443770000270446971000660449671000380456285600570460085600920465799101744009450896620251007155101.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250909t20252025enkad   sb    001 d eng d  z9781805116592 (hbk.)  z9781805116585 (pbk.)  a9781805116608q(pdf)  a9781805116622q(HTML)  a9781805116615q(epub)  a(OCoLC)1535815135  aStSaULbengerda00aInterprofessional approach to refugee healthh[electronic resource] :ba practical guide for interdisciplinary health and social care teams /cedited by Emer McGowan, Djenana Jalovcic and Sarah Quinn. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xx, 386 pages) :b23 colour illustrations, 6 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

This timely and practical book provides essential guidance for professionals-particularly those new to working in this context-on how to deliver compassionate, culturally responsive, and effective care to forcibly displaced individuals and communities. Drawing on personal narratives of displacement, international research, global best practices, and firsthand professional experience, this volume addresses the many challenges refugees face in accessing appropriate health and social care, including trauma, chronic illness, mental health conditions, housing insecurity, and language barriers. Contributions from a diverse range of professionals-across nursing, occupational therapy, psychology, psychotherapy, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, and more-highlight the interprofessional collaboration necessary to meet these multifaceted needs. Through real-life case studies, reflective prompts, and a strong focus on person-centred, equitable care, this book centres the lived experiences of refugees and emphasizes the importance of listening, learning, and adapting care to each individual's story. A vital resource for practitioners, students, policymakers, and educators, this book bridges the gap between evidence and practice and empowers professionals to build inclusive and responsive systems of care for those affected by forced migration."--Publisher's website.  aFunded by Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. 0aRefugeesxHealth and hygiene. 0aRefugeesxHealth and hygienevCase studies.1 aMcGowan, Emer,eeditor.1 aJalovcic, Djenana,eeditor.1 aQuinn, Sarah,eeditor.2 aWestern Norway University of Applied Sciences,efunding body.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0479zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0479.jpgzConnect to cover image05563nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202200220023802200230026003500220028304000210030504100130032610000260033924501970036526400460056226400110060830000400061933600260065933700260068533800360071149000550074750000440080250600480084653800360089450000640093054001840099450400650117854600650124350515670130852014720287560000480434765000320439565000540442765000480448165000550452965000510458470000610463570000600469671000380475683000540479485600570484885600920490599101745077920896620251007155337.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250916t20252025enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805115267 (hbk.)  z9781805115250 (pbk.)  a9781805115274q(pdf)  a9781805115298q(HTML)  a9781805115281q(EPUB)  z2050-7933 (Print)  a2054-362X (Online)  a(OCoLC)1537555337  aStSaULbengerda0 aengatib1 aJyab, Menla,eauthor.10aCareful village and other khasag from Tibeth[electronic resource] :bthe Amdo comedies of Menla Jyab /cMenla Jyab ; with translation and introduction by Timothy Thurston and Tsering Samdrup. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2025. 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xxii, 306 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aWorld oral literature seriesx2054-362X ;vvol. 13  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aEPUB Accessibility Report available on publisher's website.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Emerging in the 1980s during a period of cultural revival in Tibetan communities, khashag fused traditional Tibetan expression with influences from Han Chinese xiangsheng (crosstalk), evolving into a medium of sharp societal critique and joyous entertainment. Menla Jyab, a pioneering performer, used his platform in radio, television, to craft comedies described as 'having meaning in every line'. Drawing on a decade and a half of Tim Thurston's research and his and Tsering Samdrup's close connections with Menla Jyab, this groundbreaking work brings these culturally significant performances to English-speaking audiences for the first time. This richly contextualized volume explores the genre's linguistic intricacies, performative brilliance, and cultural resonance, highlighting its role in overcoming literacy barriers to reach a broad audience. The translations, based on published scripts and transcribed recordings, are accompanied by insightful notes that illuminate the subtle interplay of humor, critique, and identity in Tibetan life. Careful Village is an indispensable resource for scholars and enthusiasts of Tibetan culture, performance studies, and oral traditions."--Publisher's website.10aJyab, MenlaxCriticism and interpretation.. 0aFolk drama, TibetanvTexts. 0aFolk drama, TibetanzChinazAmdo (Region)vTexts. 0aFolk drama, TibetanxHistory and criticism. 0aTibetan drama (Comedy)vTranslations into English. 0aTibetan drama (Comedy)xHistory and criticism.1 aThurston, Timothy,etranslator,ewriter of introduction.1 aSamdrup, Tsering,etranslator,ewriter of introduction.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aWorld oral literature series ;vv. 13.x2054-362X40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0452zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0452.jpgzConnect to cover image04106nam a2200397 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000260013602000250016203500220018704000210020910000330023024501440026326400470040726400110045430000400046533600260050533700260053133800360055750000440059350600480063753800360068554002240072150400670094550510310101252013750204365000340341865000330345265000360348571000380352185600570355985600920361699101745077930896620251007155228.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||250916t20252025enk d   sb    001 d eng d  z9781805117070 (hbk.)  z9781805117063  (pbk.)  a9781805117087q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1537554285  aStSaULbengerda1 aOsborne, Martin J.,eauthor.10aModels in political economyh[electronic resource] :bcollective choice, voting, elections, bargaining, and rebellion /cMartin J.

It presents the main formal models used to study the behavior of individuals and groups in political contexts, from choosing public policies and participating as voters and candidates in elections, to staging revolutions. Complete mathematical proofs are provided, to clarify the assumptions and deepen understanding. Part I presents models of collective choice. The main question is whether methods exist for selecting a reasonable compromise when individuals' preferences differ. Models of voting are studied in Part II. Included are models in which the individuals differ in their preferences as well as ones in which they differ in their information. One chapter considers the implications of individuals having ethical concerns, and another studies a model of sequential voting. Models of electoral competition, under the assumption of various motivations for the candidates, are discussed in Part III. One chapter is devoted to the application of these models to the study of redistributive policy. The book concludes with Part IV, which covers models of bargaining and rebellion. The book offers a rigorous yet accessible foundation for understanding how formal tools can illuminate political phenomena."--Publisher's website. 0aEconomicsxPolitical aspects. 0aVotingxMathematical models. 0aElectionsxMathematical models.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0490zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0490.jpgzConnect to cover image04336nam a2200565 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304100130027410000430028724502770033026400470060726400110065430000400066533600260070533700260073133800360075749000620079350000440085550600480089953800360094754001660098350001530114950400430130254600900134550504360143552011290187160000370300060000720303760000990310965000480320870000280325670000510328470000410333570000420337670000370341870000720345571000380352783000560356585600570362185600920367899101747237240896620251003151729.0m     o  d        cr##n#########251003t20252025enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805116035 (hbk.)  z9781805116028 (pbk.)  a9781805116042q(pdf)  z2754-0634 (Print)  z2754-0642 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1537021937  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghlat0 aSimon,cof Faversham,d-1306,eauthor.10aQuestions on the posterior analytics (second redaction)h[electronic resource] /cSimon of Faversham ; critical edition by Iacopo Costa, Gustavo Fernández Walker, John Longeway, and Ana María Mora-Márquez ; English translation by John Longeway and Matthew Wennemann. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xxii, 309 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe medieval text consortium seriesx2754-0642 ;vvol. 2.  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

The Posterior Analytics, one of Aristotle's most important treatises, addresses the nature of scientific demonstration. Faversham's two extant commentaries on The Posterior Analytics are invaluable witnesses to key elements of late medieval accounts of scientific demonstration, including views on the extent and limits of demonstration, its metaphysical underpinnings, and its epistemic power. The commentary edited here, together with the accompanying translation, offers new insight into Simon of Faversham's philosophy-a fascinating chapter in the history of late medieval thought. It also deepens our understanding of the philosophical discussions on demonstration and related topics that took place during the early period of Europe's university history, and of the ways in which these discussions drew on earlier philosophical developments in non-European traditions, notably the Islamic philosophical tradition.."--Publisher's website.00aAristotle.tPosterior analytics.00aSimon,cof Faversham,d-1306.tQuestiones super librum Posteriorum.00aSimon,cof Faversham,d-1306.tQuestiones super librum PosteriorumvTranslations into English. 0aDemonstration (Logic)vEarly works to 1800.1 aCosta, Iacopo,eeditor.1 aFernández Walker, Gustavo, $d 1979-eeditor.1 aAna María Mora-Márquez,eeditor.1 aLongeway, John,eeditor,etranslator.1 aWennemann, Matthew,etranslator.02aSimon,cof Faversham,d-1306.tQuestiones super librum Posteriorum.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aMedieval text consortium series ;vv. 2.x2754-064240uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0468zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0468.jpgzConnect to cover image03043nam a2200373 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016103500220018604000210020810000350022924500960026426400470036026400110040730000400041833600260045833700260048433800360051050000440054650600480059053800360063854001840067450400550085850502570091352012790117065000330244971000380248285600570252085600920257799101747357270896620251006160616.0m     o  d        cr##n#########251006t20252025enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805117155 (hbk.)  z9781805117148 (pbk.)  a9781805117162q(pdf)  a(OCoLC)1540662569  aStSaULbengerda1 aGrabowski, J.q(Jan),eauthor.10aRepresentation theory :ba categorical approachh[electronic resource] /cJan E.

Guiding readers through the transition between structure theory and representation theory, this textbook explores how algebraic objects like groups and rings act as symmetries of other structures. Using the accessible yet powerful language of category theory, the book reimagines standard approaches to topics such as modules and algebras in a way that unlocks modern treatments of more advanced topics such as quiver representations and even representations of Hopf algebras and categories. Aimed at undergraduate students with prior exposure to linear algebra and basic group theory, the book introduces categories early and uses them throughout, providing a cohesive framework that mirrors current mathematical research. Though technically sophisticated, it also includes examples and exercises designed to develop intuition and understanding. Grabowski's inclusion of computational tools such as SageMath offers a valuable and traditionally underdeveloped bridge between abstract theory and hands-on exploration. This is a uniquely valuable guide for students ready to stretch their understanding of the subject's conceptual depth and evolving frontiers."--Publisher's website. 0aRepresentations of algebras.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0492zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0492.jpgzConnect to cover image03650nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020803500220023104000210025304300120027410000270028624500890031326400470040226400110044930000730046033600260053333700260055933800360058549000670062150000440068850600480073253800360078054001660081650000700098250000920105250400550114454600730119950502140127252012540148665000300274065000290277070000270279971000750282671000380290183000560293985600570299585600920305299101747899250896620251117145532.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||251010t20252025enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805113355 (hbk.)  z9781805113348 (pbk.)  a9781805113362q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1544803083  aStSaULbengerda  aa-jo---1 aHerin, Bruno,eauthor.12aA grammar of Jordanian Arabich[electronic resource] :cBruno Herin and Enam Al-Wer. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xxvi, 499 pages) :b12 illustrations, 230 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 39  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

It investigates the phonology and morphosyntax of Jordanian Arabic, with a focus on the traditional sedentary varieties of Central and Northern Jordan, locally known as Balgawi and Horani. Although theory-neutral, the description is typologically informed and should be accessible to anyone broadly acquainted with linguistics. The structure of the grammar follows the traditional division between phonology, morphology and syntax. The phonology chapter discusses both segmental and suprasegmental features. The morphology section investigates the structure of the major word classes, both open and closed, as well as minor classes such as interjections, discourse markers and other uninflected particles. The chapter on syntax explores the internal structure of noun and verb phrases and the syntax of simple and complex clauses as well as transversal phenomena such as agreement, negation and information structure. The book also includes a section devoted to the social dialectology of Jordan, and a discussion of the data upon which the grammar is based and three transcribed and translated texts belonging to the traditional dialect."--Publisher's website. 0aArabic languagexGrammar. 0aArabic languagezJordan.1 aAl-Wer, Enam,eauthor.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 39.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0410zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0410.jpgzConnect to cover image03727nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000260016102000260018702000250021303500220023804000210026010000290028124500980031026400470040826400110045530000590046633600260052533700260055133800360057750000440061350600480065753800360070554001840074150000660092550001120099150400530110350502570115652015180141360000650293165000510299665000470304771000380309485600570313285600920318999101747899260896620251010163310.0m     o  d        cr##n#########251011t20252025enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805116974 (hbk.)  z9781805116967 (pbk.)  a9781805117001q(HTML)  a9781805116998q(EPUB)  a9781805116981q(PDF)  a(OCoLC)1540663962  aStSaULbengerda1 aMcMorran, Will,eauthor.10aSensing violence :breading with the Marquis de Sadeh[electronic resource] /cWill McMorran. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xiv, 252 pages) :b6 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

To find out, this provocative and original book turns to the works of an author synonymous with sexual violence: the Marquis de Sade. Drawing on psychology, cognitive literary studies, and empirical research, it argues that reading is a fundamentally embodied act - and one that implicates us far more than we might like to think in fictional depictions of violence. This book turns not just to Sade for answers, but to his readers. Where previous studies have focussed either on Sade's language or his philosophy, this one places the lived experience of actual readers at the heart of its investigations. Taking particular scenes from Sade's fiction, from a young girl posing as a statue in 'Eugénie de Franval' to the brutal rape of the heroine of Justine, this book explores what happens not just on the page but in the minds and bodies of readers as they bring these scenes to life. Drawing on questionnaires completed by readers of those scenes, and on his own experience as a reader, teacher and translator of Sade, the author challenges the disembodied approach that has dominated Sade studies and literary criticism more broadly over recent decades. This is not just a book about Sade-it's a radical exploration of what happens to us when we are confronted with scenes of violence. Urgent, accessible, and personal, it offers a new model for understanding reading as a matter of making sensations as well as making sense."--Publisher's website.10aSade,cmarquis de,d1740-1814xCriticism and interpretation. 0aViolence in literaturexPsychological aspects. 0aRape in literaturexPsychological aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0488zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0488.jpgzConnect to cover image05056nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026024501860028126400470046726400110051430000680052533600260059333700260061933800360064550000440068150600480072553800360077354001820080950000700099150000880106150400510114950517560120052012530295665000440420965000340425365000360428770000490432370000390437271000380441185600570444985600920450699101748303550896620251117151158.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||251028t20252025enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805116080 (hbk.)  z9781805116073 (pbk.)  a9781805116097q(pdf)  a9781805116110q(HTML)  a9781805116103q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1547601119  aStSaULbengerda00aPerformance research methods :binterdisciplinary methods for theatre, dance and performance studiesh[electronic resource] /cedited by Liesbeth Groot Nibbelink and Laura Karreman. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xxii, 456 pages) :b18 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

While many volumes focus on individual methods, this book uniquely surveys a range of approaches, presenting their historical background, analytical potential, practical application, and interdisciplinary relevance. Designed with clarity and usability in mind, each chapter follows a consistent structure: introduction, contextual framing, practical application, case study demonstration, interdisciplinary expansion, and suggestions for further reading. This format enables readers to compare methods with ease and understand how each can be adapted to real-world research. Developed by scholars actively teaching these methods in graduate and undergraduate programs, this hands-on volume addresses a key gap in the field: the lack of explicit, accessible discussions of performance research methods. Responding to the societal, technological, and ecological contexts of contemporary performance, the book makes visible the knowledge practices that often remain confined to the classroom."--Publisher's website. 0aPerforming artsxResearchxMethodology. 0aDancexResearchxMethodology. 0aTheaterxResearchxMethodology.1 aGroot Nibbelink, Liesbeth,eeditor,eauthor.1 aKarreman, Laura,eeditor,eauthor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0469zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0469.jpgzConnect to cover image03704nam a2200457 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021203500220023804000210026010000400028124501010032126400470042226400110046930000620048033600260054233700260056833800360059450000440063050600480067453800360072254001840075850000700094250000880101250400530110050503090115352014650146265000340292765000330296165000380299465000270303271000380305985600570309785600920315499101748303820896620251117125148.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||251028t20252025enka    sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805116448 (hbk.)  z9781805116431 (pbk.)  a9781805116455q(pdf)  a9781805116479q(HTML)  a9781805116462q(EPUB)  a(OCoLC)1546825730  aStSaULbengerda1 aFairbairn, Kevin Toksöz,eauthor.10aHylo narrans :bechoes of material marronageh[electronic resource] /cKevin Toksöz Fairbairn. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xviii, 254 pages) :b30 illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Blending metalwork, experimental instrument-building, and philosophical inquiry, the book listens closely to brass not just as material, but as storyteller-what the author calls hylo narrans, echoing Sylvia Wynter's invocation of homo narrans. Grounded in their practice spanning artisanal craftsmanship and industrial labor, the author examines how materials respond, resist, and reshape meaning within the workshop, the concert hall, and the broader social fabric. By introducing chimeracords-hybrid sound objects forged from factory detritus-and their affordance for sonic experimentation, 'Hylo Narrans' challenges Western narratives of purity, utility, and control, inviting readers to consider alternative storylines posed by materials-in-flight. Weaving theories of marronage through situated acoustic knowledge, this book is essential reading for those working at the intersection of sound, matter, and community. It speaks to experimental musicians, sound artists, artistic researchers, and theorists interested in how sonic materiality relates to social space, cultural memory, and communal wellbeing. With a deep commitment to sonic collectivity and intermaterial dialogue, this volume reimagines the workshop as a site of resistance, resonance, and relational creativity."--Publisher's website. 0aBrass instrumentsxAcoustics. 0aMetalsxAcoustic properties. 0aMaroonsxSocial life and customs. 0aMusicxSocial aspects.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0476zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0476.jpgzConnect to cover image03988nam a2200505 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102000260018602000260021202200220023802200230026003500220028304000210030510000460032624501150037226400470048726400110053430000710054533600260061633700260064233800360066849000660070450000440077050600480081453800360086254001840089850000700108250000700115250000740122250400530129650505050134952012560185465000270311065000270313771000660316471000380323083000650326885600570333385600920339099101748303830896620251117125052.0m     o  d        cr||n|||||||||251023t20252025enkad   sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805115984 (hbk.)  z9781805115977 (pbk.)  a9781805115991q(pdf)  a9781805116011q(HTML)  a9781805116004q(EPUB)  z0265-0649 (Print)  z2977-845X (Online)  a(OCoLC)1546825822  aStSaULbengerda1 aEzenwafor-Afuecheta, Chikelu I.,eauthor.10aGrammar of Etulo :ba Niger-Congo (Idomoid) languageh[electronic resource] :cChikelu I.

This description establishes Etulo as a tone language characterised by a predominant SVO word order, non-inflectional morphology, prominent aspectual values, obligatory complement verbs and verb serialization, among other features. This grammar also serves as a foundation for further description of the Etulo grammar and for the development of pedagogical materials needed in Etulo language teaching. Within the Benue-Congo sub group of languages, Etulo is classified as an Idomoid language alongside seven other languages with which it shares striking linguistic similarities. These include Idoma, Igede, Yatye, Alago, Akweya, Akpa, and Eloyi, none of which has yet received a robust linguistic description in the form of a grammar. This work therefore serves as a reference work not only for Etulo, but also for other Idomoid languages yet to be described. This volume will be of interest to researchers of African linguistics in general and Idomoid languages in particular, as well as Africanists, comparative linguists and language typologists more generally."--Publisher's website. 0aEtulo (African people) 0aBenue-Congo languages.2 aPhilological Society (Great Britain),eissuing body,efunder.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aPublications of the Philological Society ;vv. 1.x2977-845X40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0467zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0467.jpgzConnect to cover image05838nam a2200517 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026903500220029204000210031404100130033510000550034824000360040324501240043926400460056326400110060930000360062033600260065633700260068233800360070849000520074450000440079650600480084053800360088854001790092450000700110350400410117354600950121450515050130952021120281460000700492660000510499670000420504771000380508983000440512785600570517185600920522899101748352960896620251117125432.0m        d        cr##n#########251031t20252025enk     sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805117186 (Hardback)  z9781805117179 (Paperback)  a9781805117193q(pdf)  a9781805117216q(HTML)  a9781805117209q(epub)  z2054-216X (Print)  a2054-2178 (Online)  a(OCoLC)1547601092  aStSaULbengerda1 aenghgre1 aPitsipios, Iakōvos G.,d1802-1865 or 9,eauthor.10aPithekos Xouth.lEnglish.f202510aXouth, the ape :ba tale of mannersh[electronic resource] /cIakovos Pitsipios ; translated by Neo G.

The novel is set in the aftermath of the Greek War of Independence. The story follows a young Greek man, desperate to present himself as a European aristocrat, who finds himself entangled with Xouth-an ape who is, in fact, a German travel writer transformed as punishment for his vanity and prejudices. Through the interactions between the protagonist and the ape-valet, Pitsipios skewers the pretensions of Greece's newly minted elites, exposing the often comical efforts to mimic Western manners and ideals. The novel lampoons the wave of Western travel writers who 'discovered' Greece, poking fun at their colonial attitudes and superficial observations. The figure of Xouth serves as both a mirror and a caricature, reflecting the absurdities of identity, authenticity, and cultural imitation in a society striving to define itself between East and West. Translated in English for the first time, with an expansive Introduction by Neo G. Christodoulides, the novel explores themes of national identity, the pitfalls of mimicry, and the complexities of cultural exchange. Rich with allusions to both Greek and European literary traditions, Pitsipios draws sharp parallels between his characters' quests for legitimacy and the real historical debates around language, class, and belonging in 19th-century Greece. The novel's polyglossic style-a blend of archaic, official, and colloquial Greek-further emphasises the layered and fractured nature of Greek identity at the time. Despite its initial obscurity, the novel's relevance endures: its sharp satire and insightful social analysis make it not just a humorous adventure, but a revealing document of post-revolutionary Greece and its ongoing negotiations with modernity, Western influence, and self-perception. 'Xouth, the Ape' is a hidden gem that deserves renewed attention from readers, scholars, and anyone fascinated by the crossroads of cultures."--Publisher's website.10aHölderlin, Friedrich,d1770-1843xCriticism and interpretation.10aHölderlin, Friedrich,d1770-1843.tHyperion.1 aChristodoulides, Neo G.,etranslator.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen Book classics ;vv. 13.x2054-217840uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0493zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0493.jpgzConnect to cover image03981nam a2200397 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013603500220016104000210018310000290020424501500023326400470038326400110043030000690044133600260051033700260053633800360056250000440059850600480064253800360069054001840072650400530091050513250096352009860228865000200327465000380329465000370333270000270336971000380339685600570343485600920349199101749034360896620251117125538.0m     o  d        cr##n#########251104t20252025enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805116226 (pbk.)  a9781805116233q(PDF)  a(OCoLC)1548603127  aStSaULbengerda1 aBowles, Samuel,eauthor.10aAllocation, distribution, and policy :bnotes, problems, and solutions in microeconomicsh[electronic resource] /cSamuel Bowles and Weikai Chen. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (vi, 264 pages) :billustrations (some colour)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Bowles and Chen provide problem sets and exam questions (with carefully explained solutions) based on the new microeconomics, engaging learners with applications to income distribution, limited competition in goods and labor markets, climate change, and other public policy topics.

A Place of Dreams / Alison Twells.  aThis book is a compelling blend of mystery, history, and creative non-fiction, that brings to life the wartime story of Norah Hodgkinson (1925-2009), a working-class schoolgirl, later clerical worker, and a prolific diarist. The book opens with a sailor's letter of thanks for a pair of socks that Norah had knitted for the Royal Navy Comforts Fund in 1940-a gift that led to an exciting romance with the sailor's dashing airman brother. But as the author pieces together Norah's diary entries and the sailor's letters, questions emerge about the men's identities and intentions. 'A Place of Dreams' uncovers a dark tale of male rivalry and wartime anonymity, and a young woman's appetite for life and love amidst unexpected dangers. Blending microhistory with family history and life-writing, the author navigates the challenges of Norah's tweet-like diary entries. Inviting the reader into Norah's world, she explores ways of uncovering the lives of ordinary women, so often absent from official archives. A Place of Dreams is a timely story in the era of #MeToo, juxtaposing Norah's wartime experiences with contemporary feminist writing to pose questions-about sex, desire, modesty, and shame-that Norah could not voice in 1940s England. By reflecting on the relevance of history today, the story explores whether narratives like Norah's can spark broader conversations about "intimate justice" and its connection to politics and cultural change. On a personal level, it delves into what Norah's wartime experience means to the author as a historian, feminist, Norah's great-niece, and a mother of girls. This volume will appeal to readers with an interest in women's lives in the past, and academics and students in the fields of women's and gender history, the history of sexuality, the social and cultural history of war/WW2 studies, diary studies, and the relationships of history, fiction and life-writing."--Publisher's website.10aHodgkinson, Norah,d1925-2009vDiaries. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xWomen. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xPersonal narratives, British. 0aMan-woman relationshipszGreat Britainy20th century.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0461zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0461.jpgzConnect to cover image03424nam a2200433 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022104000210024704300120026810000380028024501130031826400460043126400110047730000590048833600260054733700260057333800360059950000440063550600480067953800360072754001820076350000700094550400530101550503400106852012730140860000290268165100490271065100440275971000380280385600570284185600920289899101749507880896620251111153323.0m        d        cr##n#########251111t20252025enka    sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805116929 (Hardback)  z9781805116912 (Paperback)  a9781805116936q(pdf)  a9781805116950q(HTML)  a9781805116943q(EPUB)  aStSaULbengerda  ae------1 aWebster, Charles,d1936-eauthor.12aA portrait of Samuel Hartlib :bin search of universal bettermenth[electronic resource] /cCharles Webster. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2025. 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xviii, 294 pages) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Though educated in Eastern Europe, Hartlib spent his adult life in London, where he became a prolific correspondent and chronicler. His Ephemerides, spanning 1634 to 1660, and his extensive correspondence with leading thinkers across Britain and Protestant Europe offer an unparalleled window into the era's religious, political, and scientific ferment. This volume goes beyond previous studies in both scope and depth, drawing extensively on archival sources and offering new interpretations of Hartlib's network and influence. Organized chronologically, it explores the wide-ranging social, economic, and ideological pursuits of Hartlib and his collaborators-many of them renowned figures in their own right-and his close alignment with the Cromwellian cause. Providing the most complete portrait to date of the Hartlib circle's emergence and impact, this study sets a new benchmark for scholarship and invites renewed engagement with one of the early modern period's most visionary projects of knowledge, reform, and communication."--Publisher's website.10aHartlib, Samuel,d-1662. 0aEuropexHistoryxReligious aspectsvSources. 0aEuropexHistoryy17th centuryvSources.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0486zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0486.jpgzConnect to cover image04453nam a2200529 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000250011102000250013602000250016102200220018602200230020804000210023124501870025226400470043926400110048630000390049733600260053633700260056233800360058849000670062450000440069150600480073553800360078354001660081950000700098550000920105550400510114750512130119852008110241165000490322265000400327165000460331165000510335770000270340870000290343570000300346471000460349471000650354071000750360571000380368083000560371885600570377485600920383199101749507890896620251111142124.0m     o  d        cr##n#########251111t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805117414 (hbk.)  z9781805117407 (pbk.)  a9781805117421q(pdf)  z2632-6906 (Print)  z2632-6914 (Online)  aStSaULbengerda04aThe intertwined world of the oral and written transmission of sacred traditions in the Middle Easth[electronic resource]  /cedited by Alba Fedeli, Geoffrey Khan and Johan Lundberg. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c[2025] 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xiv, 470 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aCambridge Semitic languages and culturesx2632-6914 ;vvol. 40  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

The means of written transmission and the textualisation of the oral reading of these scriptures exhibit many parallels, which reflect cultural contact and convergence across the various religious communities. This volume is the outcome of a project, funded jointly by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Arts and Humanities Research Council, that aimed to bring together strands of research related to various aspects of the transmission of these sacred texts in order to reach a deeper understanding of the intertwined world of the three major religions of the Middle East at their formative periods of development during the early Islamic centuries."--Publisher's website. 0aTransmission of textszMiddle EastxHistory. 0aSacred bookszMiddle EastxHistory. 0aOral communicationzMiddle EastxHistory. 0aMiddle Eastern literaturexCriticism, Textual.1 aFedeli, Alba,eeditor.1 aKhan, Geoffrey,eeditor.1 aLundberg, Johan,eeditor.2 aDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,efunder.2 aArts & Humanities Research Council (Great Britain),efunder.2 aUniversity of Cambridge.bFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aSemitic languages and cultures ;vv. 40.x2632-691440uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0498zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0498.jpgzConnect to cover image04358nam a2200445 i 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022104000210024710000280026824501660029626400460046226400110050830000400051933600260055933700260058533800360061150000440064750600480069153800360073954001820077550000700095750401130102750512300114052011040237060000600347460000390353460000420357360000700361560000400368571000380372585600570376385600920382099101749607790896620251114105617.0m        d        cr##n#########251114t20252025enk     sb    001 0deng d  z9781805114154 (Hardback)  z9781805114147 (Paperback)  a9781805114161q(pdf)  a9781805114185q(HTML)  a9781805114178q(EPUB)  aStSaULbengerda1 aWinnick, R H.,eauthor.10aJoyce's choices :bnew textual parallels in James Joyce's Dubliners, A portrait of the artist as a young man, and Ulyssesh[electronic resource] /cR.H.

By meticulously identifying hundreds of previously unknown instances of such intertextual echoes, such conscious or unconscious literary borrowings, Winnick's study complements prior works on Joyce's allusive practices by, among others, Weldon Thornton, Don Gifford, and, most recently and comprehensively, Sam Slote, Marc A.

Drawing on extensive oral history interviews, this book traces the launch and rollout of the 'New Education System' initiated by the Ministry of Education in 2018, designed to modernize curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment in the digital age and change the 'culture of learning'. The volume moves fluidly from macro-level state planning to the lived experiences of teachers and students, exploring the promises and pitfalls of top-down reform. Conducted partly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the research captures Egypt's first large-scale experiment with hybrid and distance learning. Interviews with key actors-from policymakers and tech developers to students and educators-reveal competing visions, unintended consequences, and the challenges of culturally transforming education systems in a middle-income country where private tutoring is rife, the sector is chronically under resourced, and politics overshadows policy. This book is essential reading for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers interested in education reform, digital transformation, and the role of the state in shaping learning futures in the Global South. It is also an excellent case study for courses in Middle East studies and comparative and international education."--Publisher's website. 0aEducationxEffect of technological innovations onzEgypt.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0489zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0489.jpgzConnect to cover image03898nam a2200421 u 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022104000210024724501430026826400460041126400110045730000390046833600260050733700260053333800270055950000440058650600480063053800360067854001840071450000700089850400530096850506660102152014330168760000490312060000570316970000320322670000310325871000380328985600570332785600920338499101750548190896620251205125045.0a     sb    00100 cr#|n|nnn|||||251205t20252025enk     sb    001 0 eng d  z9781805117100 (Hardback)  z9781805117094 (Paperback)  a9781805117117q(PDF)  a9781805117131q(HTML)  a9781805117124q(EPUB)  aStSaULbengerda00aSolidarity in contingency :bRorty's constructive projecth[electronic resource] /cedited by Elin Danielsen Huckerby and Marianne Janack. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2025. 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xii, 230 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomupterbc2rdamedia  avolumebcr2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Yet beyond the controversy lies a vital, underexplored side of Rorty's work: his constructive vision for fostering democratic solidarity in a world shaped by contingency and uncertainty. This volume shifts focus from defending Rorty to applying his insights for today's fractured, post-truth culture. Centered on Rorty's "Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity" (1989), the collection explores how his pragmatism helps us reimagine philosophy as a cultural practice-one grounded not in timeless truths, but in shared hopes, vocabularies, and democratic cooperation. The volume brings together seven original essays that revisit Rortyan concepts like liberal ironism, poetic redescription, eirenism, and democratic solidarity, and explore their implications for social justice, feminist theory, public discourse, and the humanities. Rather than lament relativism or retreat into essentialism, these contributions demonstrate how Rorty's philosophy offers practical, imaginative tools for navigating difference and building inclusive societies. Emphasizing creativity over certainty and solidarity over skepticism, this timely volume reclaims Rorty's legacy as a philosopher of hope-and a resource for democratic renewal in our era of radical uncertainty."--Publisher's website.10aRorty, RichardxContributions to philosophy.10aRorty, Richard.tContingency, irony, and solidarity.1 aHuckerby, Elin D.,eeditor.1 aJanack, Marianne,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0487zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0487.jpgzConnect to cover image05440nam a2200529 u 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022102200220024702200230026904000210029204300120031324501780032526400460050326400110054930000710056033600260063133700260065733800360068349000460071950000440076550600480080953800360085754001840089350000650107750000700114250400410121250518330125352013430308665000440442965000310447365000370450465000370454165000320457870000340461070000340464471000380467883000450471685600570476185600920481899101751106060896620251212103805.0aad   sb    000 0 cr#|n||||||||n251211t20252025enkad   sb    000 0 eng d  z9781805117445 (Hardback)  z9781805117438 (Paperback)  a9781805117452q(PDF)  a9781805117476q(HTML)  a9781805117469q(EPUB)  z2399-6668 (Print)  a2399-6676 (Online)  aStSaULbengerda  ae------00aMore with more :binvesting in the energy transition : 2025 European Public Investment Outlookh[electronic resource] /cedited by Floriana Cerniglia and Francesco Saraceno. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2025. 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xvi, 256 pages) :b43 illustrations, 11 tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aOpen reports seriesx2399-6676 ;vvol. 14  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0).

It examines the diverse commitments undertaken by European countries as they navigate the challenges of decarbonization and the shift to sustainable energy systems. By analyzing both the policy frameworks and the concrete instruments adopted to reach ambitious climate and energy goals, the book sheds light on the strategies shaping the continent's future. A particular emphasis is placed on the role of public investment, highlighting how state action can catalyze innovation, support infrastructure, and bridge gaps where market forces alone may fall short. Through this lens, the volume not only evaluates existing practices but also considers the broader implications for governance, equity, and long-term resilience. Written with clarity and rigor, the outlook will be of interest to policymakers, scholars, and practitioners seeking to understand the dynamics of Europe's green transition. It invites readers to consider the balance between national priorities and collective European objectives, offering valuable insights into how commitments translate into action-and how public investment can be a decisive lever for change."--Publisher's website. 0aClean energyxEconomic aspectszEurope. 0aEnergy transitionzEurope. 0aSustainable developmentzEurope.  aClean energy investmentzEurope. 0aPublic investmentszEurope.1 aCerniglia, Floriana,eeditor.1 aSaraceno, Francesco,eeditor.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher. 0aOpen reports series ;vv. 14.x2399-667640uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0499zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0499.jbgzConnect to cover image04192nam a2200517 u 450000100190000000500170001900600190003600700150005500800410007002000290011102000300014002000250017002000260019502000260022104000210024710000420026824501980031026400460050826400110055430000680056533600260063333700280065933800270068750000440071450600480075853800360080654001840084250000700102650400940109650508870119052010920207760000460316960000400321560000240325560000330327960000170331260000160332965000240334565000310336965000310340065000280343165000280345971000380348785600570352585600920358299101751116010896620251218093118.0aa    sb    001 0dcr#|n||||||||n251212t20252025enka    sb    001 0deng d  z9781805117490 (Hardback)  z9781805117483 (Paperback)  a9781805117506q(PDF)  a9781805117520q(HTML)  a9781805117513q(EPUB)  aStSaULbengerda1 aLisboa, Maria Manuel,d1963-eauthor.10aBroken :billness and disability in Antônio Francisco Lisboa, Camilo Castelo Branco, Clarice Lispector, Victor Willing, Paula Rego and Ana Palmah[electronic resource] /cMaria Manuel Lisboa. 1aCambridge :bOpen Book Publishers,c2025. 4c©2025  a1 online resource (xxiv, 206 pages) :b73 colour illustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aAvailable through Open Book Publishers.  aOpen access resource providing free access.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license (CC BY-NC 4.0).

Spanning from the eighteenth century to the present, the volume explores how sociopolitical and somatic factors such as mental illness, psychological abuse, arthritis, genital mutilation, and multiple sclerosis shaped their creativity, while also reflecting broader national, social, sexual, and political  pressures.Engaging both literature and visual art, the book offers an original and provocative perspective that unsettles conventional narratives of health, gender, and identity in Lusophone and transnational contexts. By situating canonical figures alongside emerging voices, 'Broken' bridges generations and disciplines, revealing how art and fiction transform experiences of illness and disability into critical insights on society, history, and power."--Publisher's website.10aLisboa, Antônio Francisco,d1730?-1814.10aCastelo Branco, Camilo,d1825-1890.10aLispector, Clarice.10aWilling, Victor,d1928-1988.10aRego, Paula.10aPalma, Ana. 0aDisability studies. 0aArtists with disabilities. 0aAuthors with disabilities. 0aArtistsxMental health. 0aAuthorsxMental health.2 aOpen Book Publishers,epublisher.40uhttps://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0500zConnect to e-book42uhttps://cdn.openbookpublishers.com/covers/10.11647/obp.0500.jpgzConnect to cover image
